# Encouragement: A Beacon in the Darkness

Concept of this chapter: Encouragement

*The content of this chapter comes from Li Xiaolai's video sharing in 2021-04 on the topic "Encouragement" in the series "See You in Seven Years".*

Encouragement is a valuable power that helps people overcome difficulties, pursue dreams, and boost confidence. However, in this world, not many people really know how to encourage others.

Encouragement could be the scarcest resource in the world.

Have you ever had an experience where you were confronted with setbacks or confusion, yearning for the encouragement and support of others, only to find that people around you either remained indifferent, gave empty words, or even reprimanded you?

> ***Ask yourself, when you needed encouragement the most, was there anyone to provide the encouragement you wanted?***

The answer can often be despairing. Many times, when we don't need encouragement, others haphazardly give it. But when we really need it, hardly anyone is able to properly encourage us.

Therefore, encouragement is a very important matter. But few people manage to do it well. Among those who do, even fewer are truly good at it. This is because most people are not adept at encouraging others.

## Why Is Encouragement Lacking in Society?

I believe everyone has encountered similar situations where people are trying to console you, but their way of doing so only makes you feel worse. And that's one of the better scenarios.

I had a profound experience where a relative of mine was diagnosed with lung cancer. My family and I went to visit him. Then, I witnessed him being ***"cared for"*** by others. It sounds warm, but in fact, it wasn't.

The person expressing concern did so in a way that most people would use - a lecturing tone mixed with parental-like admonishment. I'm not good at reading people's facial expressions, but looking at my relative's face, I felt his annoyance, his pain, and his eyes seemed to say:

> *Enough! Please, just leave me alone!*

At the time, I felt helpless. I didn't know what to do or say. It wasn't until I later learned about the concept of encouragement that I realized how chillingly wrong that kind of encouragement could be. If I could go back, I would stop that person from saying what they did.

In fact, there are numerous real-life examples. Just think, and we can all find that people around us - and ourselves - are really not good at encouraging others. Basically, we're failing the grade.

I believe there are two main reasons for the lack of encouragement:

One is darker - many people harbor jealousy and fear. They don't want to see others do better, be stronger, happier, or more successful than themselves. They want everyone else to be just as mediocre, stagnant, and unsuccessful. This way, they can comfort themselves, find a sense of superiority, and achieve psychological balance. They lack the courage to face the reality of others progressing while they are regressing. So when they see others fail, they are actually happy. On the surface, they are consoling the person, but in reality, they are adding insult to injury. Not to mention they will intentionally say things that upset others: "I told you so, this was not a good idea, but you didn't listen. Why didn't you listen to me?"

Many parents educate their children this way, showing how clever they are while thinking that this will teach their children a lesson and prevent future mistakes. This is not helpful, but rather harmful - they are instilling fear (see the chapter on [courage](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/010.Courage.md)).

Another less sinister, but more genuine reason is that we simply have never been taught how to encourage people properly, nor have we heard that it is something to be learned. This is a limitation of our thinking。 How can we learn to encourage others when we don't even realize that encouragement is something we need to learn?

It's not a question of whether anyone has taught us. As long as we can recognize the problem, we can think, reflect the concept of encouragement, and thus grow and progress. Even if no one teaches us, we can still take a step forward. The problem is we've never heard that encouragement needs to be learned. We've heard about learning proper breathing techniques, running techniques, but the concept of correct encouragement simply doesn't exist in most people's minds. This leads to a situation where some people don't encourage because they don't know how to. This situation often happens between teachers and students. Some say "strict teachers produce outstanding students", but I don't think so. I believe teachers who can encourage will bring out the best in their students.

The same is true for good leaders. If you can't encourage others, they won't like you. They will feel that no matter how much or how well they do, they won't be recognized. Their confidence, initiative, and enthusiasm will not be high. In a team, there will be no cohesion among members.

After understanding encouragement, we will realize that encouraging others is actually creating value for them.

Based on this understanding, we can come up with a principle worth practicing:

> ***Genuinely support and encourage others, as long as they believe their choice is correct. We should not give them confusing advice or help them weigh pros and cons. Just encourage and support them.***

Although we may not understand their choices, if they believe it is the right one, let them go ahead. Even if they fail, it's okay. They can still learn from the experience. The road ahead is long, and in the long run, it's always good for them. It's much better than regretting not having the courage to do something in the future.

## What Are the Benefits of Encouraging Others?

As we adopt the practice of encouraging others, we may be surprised to discover that we no longer feel a great need for encouragement from others. Encouraging others is like vaccinating ourselves; when we encounter setbacks, we no longer desperately need others' encouragement.

This is an astounding benefit. At the end of an interview, the host asked Elon Musk, "How would you encourage young entrepreneurs who are facing setbacks?"

Elon Musk, after some thought, stuttered, "If an entrepreneur needs encouragement from others, they shouldn't be starting a business."

Hence, not requiring others' encouragement is a huge advantage for us. When we encounter setbacks, we can bounce back on our own.

In the chapter on value, we discussed that the judgement of value depends on the receiver, not the giver.

Similarly, the value created by encouragement also depends on the receiver, not the giver.

From the perspective of the receiver, what is it that they truly need?

> ***What they yearn for is support.***

Think about it, when we feel helpless, do we really want others to lecture us, telling us what we should do?

## Methodology of Encouraging Others

The best and most effective way to encourage is through silent companionship. Just quietly be by their side, as if you were visiting someone who is unwell. Do your own thing while remaining by their side. It’s similar to how you would simply stay silent beside your partner when they are crying heavily.

The other person might fear the awkward silence and attempt to say something to ease the tension. You can tell them there's no need to speak. Isn't it tiring to keep talking so much? It’s fine to take a rest.

It's strange, the more you speak, the less they will. Conversely, if you remain silent, they will start talking. As he talk more, his emotions were released.

If you can't help but want to say something, We can share about the misfortunes that happened to us before. There's a saying, "Share your unhappiness to bring joy to everyone." There is some truth to this. Sharing your own misfortune with others can make them feel that they are not alone. Similar things happen to others too.

Another method is to do things with them. Action is always more effective than verbal support. However, this may be difficult, especially when we're not good at what they're doing. This method may be more applicable to family, partners, and children, doing certain things together with them. For example, when children encounter setbacks while learning an instrument, we, as adults, can learn along with them.

The best encouragement is never overly emotional, but rather subdued, as if it's no big deal. Overly emotional encouragement is not sustainable. It merely suppresses negative emotions temporarily. Once the intense emotions fade, they may feel worse.

Imagine this, when you go through a breakup and confide in your best friend, would you truly feel better if they responded with enthusiastic remarks like "You lose one tree, but you gain a forest"? Or, if they were nonchalant, seemingly unbothered, yet silently supportive, encouraging, and willing to share their own hardships with their ex-partner, which method would be more comforting?

If you can give the right encouragement when others need it, you will become a very valuable person. Those who receive your encouragement will feel happy and consider themselves fortunate to know you, and you will gain a sense of fulfillment from this.

Who wouldn't like such a person?

## Conclusion

Finally, I want to discuss who needs encouragement the most. Those who need encouragement the most are not necessarily people who have encountered setbacks or failures. Sometimes, people do foolish things, and setbacks are self-inflicted. Therefore, they are certainly not the ones who need encouragement the most.

We can observe the people around us to see who is doing good things, valuable things, and right things. They often walk the path less traveled, a lonely path, especially when they face setbacks or failures. They may have few or even no people around them who can provide the right encouragement. However, we can give them the right encouragement, allowing them to recover quicker, supporting their choices, and making them feel that even though many people don't understand their path, even though it's lonely, at least they're not alone. There are people who understand and support them.
