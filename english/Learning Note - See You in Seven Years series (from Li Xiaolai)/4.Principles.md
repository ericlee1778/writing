# Principles and First Principle Thinking: A New Method Beyond Traditional Thinking

Concept of this chapter: Principles

We all know that financial management is very important as it affects our quality of life and future dreams. But have you ever thought about and made a comprehensive long-term financial plan? I believe the majority of people have not.

What is a long-term financial plan? Simply put, it's a plan of how much money (the target) you need to accumulate within a certain number of years (the timeframe). For example, if you want to achieve financial freedom before you turn 40, you need to calculate how much assets and income you need, and how to reach this goal.

Sounds simple, right? However, in reality, long-term financial plans often end in failure. Why? Because successful plans generally require the following conditions:
> * Short-term
> * Clear goals
> * Precedents of success


Inherently, **long-term** financial planning contradicts these three conditions:

> * Long-term: It's difficult for humans to predict the future, especially in a world that changes so rapidly. You may not accurately estimate future income, expenditure, investment returns, inflation, etc., rendering your plan meaningless.
>
> * Unclear goals: You may not have a clear and specific goal, just arbitrarily setting a number or a concept. For instance, you may want "wealth" or "freedom", but these words mean different things to different people. You may not have considered the lifestyle and values you truly desire.
>
> * No precedent of success: You may lack a reliable and referential successful model and just blindly follow others or societal trends. For example, you might think that buying houses, cars, insurance, and financial products are the correct ways to manage finances, but are these methods really suitable for you? Can they help you achieve your goals?

From the above analysis, it's clear that long-term financial planning is neither an effective nor feasible method. So, what else can we do? I believe that we should establish long-term financial principles.

## What are principles?

Principles are fundamental rules that guide our actions and decisions, helping us make the right and reasonable choices in complex and uncertain environments. Unlike plans, principles are not specific and fixed schemes but rather flexible and adaptive ways of thinking.

So, how to establish long-term financial principles? I think we need to refer to the most fundamental axioms of things, which is what Elon Musk calls the first principles thinking.

What are the first principles thinking? Here is Elon Musk's explanation:

> *In Elon Musk's explanation, first principles thinking are a way of thinking based on fundamental facts and fundamental principles. It involves deconstructing a problem or situation into its most basic components, and then reconsidering from scratch to derive real, assumption-free conclusions.*
>
> *First principles thinking requires us to trace back to the root factors of the problem, instead of merely accepting traditional views or assumptions. It means we need to think independently, unrestricted by traditional thinking and limitations. By analyzing and understanding the fundamental principles of the problem, we can form our own unique perspectives and find innovative solutions.*
>
> *For instance, if we want to design a more efficient car, traditional thinking might suggest that we improve the existing car design and technology. However, through first principles thinking, we would reconsider the fundamental principles of a car, such as energy conversion and power requirements. This may lead to different ideas, like using new materials, redesigning the engine, etc., to achieve true innovation.*
>
> *In general, first principles thinking is an independent and in-depth way to think about problems. It encourages us to go beyond traditional viewpoints and assumptions to seek innovation and breakthroughs. Elon Musk often uses this way of thinking to drive his enterprises and innovative projects.*

So, how can we apply first principles thinking to establish long-term financial principles? I believe we can learn from a very important axiom in physics:

> ***Velocity and Acceleration***

What are velocity and acceleration? Simply put, velocity is the distance an object moves in a unit of time, and acceleration is the rate of change in an object's velocity within a unit of time.

Why are velocity and acceleration important for both physics and finance? Because they determine whether an object or a person can reach a goal. For instance, only with sufficient velocity can we break free from the Earth's gravity and fly into space. If we want to fly into space faster, a constant velocity is not enough; we need the velocity to increase constantly, which is acceleration, or the growth rate of velocity.

Similarly, in the field of finance, there's a very important concept:

> ***Inflation***

What is inflation? Simply put, it's the phenomenon of a decline in the purchasing power of money. For example, 10 years ago, you could buy 10 pounds of apples with 10 dollar; but now, with 10 dollar, you may only be able to buy 5 pounds of apples. This means that the purchasing power of 100 yuan has declined by half, that is, inflation has occurred.

Why is inflation important for finance? Because it determines whether your money can maintain or increase its value. For instance, the average annual inflation rate of major countries is about 6%. This means if you keep your money in the bank without doing anything, you'll lose 6% of purchasing power each year. It's as if your money is constantly shrinking, and your wealth is steadily decreasing. If you want to maintain or increase your wealth, you need your money to have a growth rate higher than the inflation rate, that is, to have a positive acceleration.

From this, we draw some principles:
> 1. The rate of wealth accumulation should exceed inflation (average 6% annually);
>
> 2. If you want to achieve financial freedom earlier, the rate of wealth accumulation needs to grow.

It seems very simple, something everyone knows. However, knowing does not necessarily mean understanding, let alone being able to achieve it.

Let's see what things align with the above principles:

> 1. Financial products are not a good choice because their return rates are often lower than the inflation rate.
>
> 2. Investment is one of the few economic activities available to ordinary people that can satisfy the above two principles at the same time. Therefore, it's crucial to learn about investment early, the earlier the better.
>
> 3. Working for others ultimately leads to a dead end, because no company can offer long-term salaries growth that are not lower than the inflation rate, not to mention raising salary at an acceleration rate.

Therefore, we should not only work for our bosses but also for our own growth, learning various skills and cultivating different abilities. Eventually, we will no longer depend on others to pay us, but instead provide value directly to the market and achieve financial independence. This way, the money we earn will be linked to our output, not to our time.

This is the value that the concept of principles brings us, guiding what we should not do, what we should do, and how we should do it.
