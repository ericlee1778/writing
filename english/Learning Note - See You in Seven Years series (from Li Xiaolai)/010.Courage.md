Courage, a word that seems ordinary yet profound, what is it exactly? If we look it up on Baidu Encyclopedia, we will see this definition: Courage is the spirit of daring to challenge, daring to take responsibility, and never backing down from any difficulty. If we delve deeper into Wikipedia, we will see a more in-depth explanation: Courage (also referred to as bravery) is the choice and will of the subject to confront these complex situations and dangers in the face of troubles, pain, danger, uncertainty, or threat, knowing the pressure these difficulties bring, yet still maintaining confidence, staying calm, discovering inner strength, and using it to face challenges.

These two definitions, whether concise or detailed, all present us with a common truth: Courage is a quality that cannot be imitated, cannot be disguised. You may be able to feign your intelligence, you may be able to feign your talents, you may even be able to feign your [character](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/9.Character.md), but you absolutely cannot feign your courage. This is because courage only truly reveals itself when we are actually facing difficulties and challenges. Without courage, you cannot overcome your fear, cannot surpass yourself, and even less likely to achieve your dreams.

So, why is courage so important? In my view, courage is one of the most important qualities we humans possess. Because it determines whether we can complete anything we want to accomplish. No matter how high your IQ is, no matter how great your talent is, or how many qualities you have accumulated through hard work, if you do not have the courage to face all the difficulties, to do what you want to do, then you can never complete what you want to do.

Here is a fact that we all need to reflect on. That is, for many of us, although we understand some of the truths of life, we are unable to apply these truths to real life. For example, we all know that learning is very important, but there are many people who are unwilling to invest time and energy to learn. We all know that change is necessary, but there are many people who would rather be content with the status quo and not willing to try new things. We all know that progress is good for us, but there are many people who are content with a mediocre life and not willing to pursue excellence.

The reason these people cannot achieve these truths, on the one hand, is because they do not truly understand the deep implications behind these truths. They have only superficially agreed with these correct viewpoints, but they have not truly comprehended the truth and value behind these viewpoints. On the other hand, more importantly, they lack courage.

Courage is a necessary condition for our human progress. Only with courage can we dare to think, dare to reflect, dare to discover the problems and shortcomings that we have, and find the areas we need to improve. Unfortunately, many people lack such courage. They fear that thinking and reflecting will force them to face facts they don't want to admit or plunge them into despair. They use phrases like "*Why think so much?*" to shirk their responsibilities and challenges.

Courage can also give us the ability to change, to adapt to new environments and needs, to pursue a better life. However, many people lack this kind of courage. They would rather be content with the status quo, unwilling to try new things, such as switching career path, and they use phrases like "*What if I can't do well, or the result after the change is not as good as I imagined, what should I do?*" to make excuses for themselves.

Courage can also give us the wisdom to invest in ourselves, to purchase things that can improve our learning and work efficiency, to learn things that can increase our knowledge and skills. However, many people lack such courage. They fear that what they spend money on may be useless, or not easy to use, or what they learn may be useless, or not applicable, or not used well. They use phrases like "*Isn't this a waste of money?*" or "*Is this useful? Is it really necessary?*" that limit their own growth.

I have seen some people who are unwilling to spend time learning to invest because they are afraid to manage their own money. They would rather rely on rumors, follow the trend of others to invest. They lack the courage to use their own abilities to make money. So, won't they lose money? If they lose money, they will push the responsibility onto others.

This actually explains from another angle that it takes courage to take responsibility. Courageous people take their commitments seriously, and they approach everything with the attitude of fulfilling their promises. Therefore, they do not make promises lightly, they are not glib talkers.

When we discuss how to cultivate courage, we inevitably ask, what common characteristics do those who have courage have? Here I want to make it clear, my personal view is, whether a person has courage or not is actually determined by two factors: fear and an growth mindset.

## Fear

First, let's talk about fear. Fear is an innate emotional reaction that we all possess. From an evolutionary perspective, fear, to some extent, has a positive protective effect on our survival as it prompts us to take protective measures when facing danger and threats, thus avoiding harm. However, if fear is excessive, or if irrational fear controls our actions and thoughts, it can become an obstacle to our progress.

In our lives, fear is often instilled in us. For instance, parents might tell their children through scare tactics that if they don't study hard, they will only end up becoming a manual labor in the future. Teachers might tell students that if they failed the exam, they may have to resit the class. In the workplace, bosses might warn employees that if their work efficiency isn't high, they could be fired. All of these scenarios instill fear to stimulate us to take action.

In the short term, scare tactics are very effective. This is because fear makes us abandon deep thinking and focus only on the immediate task at hand. However, in the long term, being driven to do things out of fear results in outcomes that are entirely different from voluntarily choosing to do something after careful consideration.

People pushed to a certain point might become desperate, reckless, and even do irrational things. But those with courage will use reason and judgment to analyze and solve problems. They will guide their actions based on their values and goals, and they will overcome difficulties and setbacks with their faith and confidence.

So, we should not instill fear in ourselves or others, nor should we use scare tactics to drive us or others to act. Fear can affect and infiltrate our thinking, making us lack the necessary courage when facing choices and actions.

## Growth Mindset

Next, let's talk about an growth mindset. People with growth mindset possess unique qualities and attitudes.

They do not compare themselves with others, only with their past selves. Even if their current performance is not good, they do not fear being ridiculed or humiliated, which would lead them to give up their efforts. This is because they have less fear than others.

When a person constantly compares themselves with others, they may end up feeling less confident and courageous. Because most of the time, the reality gap is often larger than we imagine, which can make them lose the courage to even try. They might think, '*The gap is so large, I can't compete with them. Why should I even try? Doesn't this make me look like a fool?*' This kind of fear makes them afraid of failure, afraid of not doing well, and generates negative thoughts in their minds, preventing them from trying new things.

But people with growth mindset are different. They have the courage to try things they are not good at, believing that as long as they try once or twice more, they will perform better than others. They believe they can learn faster and do better.

They have the courage to change and do not give up easily just because their starting point are lower. Most of the time, the starting point we see is not the actual starting point. Others may have started doing things long ago. But for those with an growth mindset, even when comparing themselves with others, they only compare their future selves with the current others. They believe that as long as they spend as much time learning and accumulating as others, they will not be inferior to anyone.

They have the courage to face losses. When it's time to act, they do so without hesitation, not afraid of losses. This is different from those with a fixed mindset who seek stability. The latter avoid taking risks and miss opportunities for gains due to their overemphasis on stability.

They have the courage to choose delayed gratification. They believe that as long as they do the right things, they will eventually be rewarded. Even if they can't see the result now, they still believe that as long as they keep trying, and as long as they do the right things, they will definitely be rewarded in the end.

They have the courage to be the best version of themselves. Once they start something, they will give it their all, no matter how difficult it is, they won't easily give up.

They have the courage to accept their imperfections and actively improve to strive for the best. They have the courage to admit their mistakes and correct them bravely. Because they know that only by correcting their mistakes can they become better. When they become better, they will reap more benefits, benefits they could not have imagined before.

They have the courage to be independent and be different. They trust their judgment and logic, daring to choose the road less traveled. When others are still hesitating, they have already started to act.

They have the courage to admit their mediocrity. They know that everyone is ordinary, success is not achieved overnight, but comes from taking one step at a time, perseverance, and courage.

Looking back at human history, all successful people have one thing in common, and that is courage. Without courage, they couldn't accomplish great things. To accomplish something great, the difficulties they often face are beyond what others can imagine. Even when they decide to pursue their goals, they often cannot clearly see the difficulties ahead. They are not aware that this decision means they will face many unknown problems and difficulties. Despite the rough road ahead, they choose to move forward because they have courage.
