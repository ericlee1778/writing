Facing this world, we are all puzzle solvers. What we face are not jigsaw puzzles or sudoku, but various problems in life, and the complexity of these problems far exceeds any game. What tools should we equip ourselves with to maximize the chances of success when facing these challenges? The answer is: **Simplicity**. Fundamental principles should be kept simple, the simpler, the better. The most fundamental concepts must be easy to understand. We need to pursue simplicity in concepts, principles, strategies, methods, and logic. All universal principles in our lives should be simple and easy to understand.

We often forget this fact, and thus we become flustered when facing problems. We try to build complex models to explain the world around us, and although these models seem very precise, they often fail due to their complexity. This does not mean that we should abandon complexity, but we need to recognize that simplicity is the basis for our understanding and handling of complex problems.

## Lessons from Langton's Ant

Let's explain this point with an example: [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant). This is a theoretical model of a creature that moves on an infinite black and white grid map. The ant follows two basic rules: on a black square, turn right 90 degrees and change the color of the square; on a white square, turn left 90 degrees and change the color of the square. Then move to the next square. Although the rules are simple, the behavior pattern of the ant is complex and unpredictable. After the ant moves more than ten thousand steps, it suddenly enters a stable state, starts moving in a fixed direction continuously, forming a straight line similar to a highway. This phenomenon is called "Langton's Ant Highway". What if the rules are more complex? For example, let 7 ants run together at the same time. Sometimes ants even walk backwards on the "highway".

This model provides us with an important insight: even if the rules are simple, situations that we cannot predict may still occur.

Simplicity has a characteristic that it is not only applicable within a specific field but can also be applied across fields. For example, the concept of ecosystem in biology can be applied to market economy in economics. If we overprotect (intervene) a certain endangered animal, it may make them weaker and unable to adapt to environmental changes, thus accelerating their extinction. Similarly, if we deliberately avoid small forest fires, it will lead to the accumulation of energy (potential energy) of dead branches and leaves, until one day an accidental fire occurs, all potential energy will be ignited by a spark, forming an unstoppable fire. This biological principle perfectly explains the market economy, telling us not to intervene the free market excessively.

The concept of Langton's Ant can also be linked with network effects. When a network has a very large number of nodes, the connections between nodes in the network will grow geometrically. The same goes for rules. As the rules and variables increase, the complexity of a system will also grow exponentially. Because there are too many variables, the possible results will also increase, and things will inevitably out of our control. This is because we cannot foresee all possible situations, especially when the rules become more complex.

## Lessons from Albert Einstein

We can also learn the concept of **simplicity** from Einstein's theory of relativity. It is well known that Einstein's theory of relativity has made a significant contribution to physics. However, few people know that another reason why Einstein's theory of relativity is so famous is because it is an exploration of an ultimate theory in physics, aiming to explain various physical phenomena in the natural world with a concise theoretical framework. Such a unified theory aims to reveal the intrinsic connections between fundamental particles and forces, describing the basic laws of the universe in the simplest way possible.

This bears a striking resemblance to the concept of simplicity that we advocate. Only when things are sufficiently simple and fundamental can patterns be discovered and the majority of noise filtered out. Then, based on this most solid foundation, we can develop upwards. This is the history of human civilization's development.

## Methodology of Keeping Things Simple

Simple methods are often the best and easiest to implement. The most basic concepts are often the most useful. Complex methods often discourage people from continuing, complex concepts lead to confusion, and confusion makes complex concepts lose their guiding significance. Simplicity does not mean ambiguity, simplicity can also be clear, this should not be confused.

So, how do we simplify things, principles, and concepts? Good teachers can explain complex things in simple language, similarly, only when we can explain things clearly in simple language do we really understand it. This is the methodology of simplifying concepts.

While seeking simplicity, we should also seek its applicability elsewhere, as well as its connection with other concepts or principlesï¼Œ just like what Einstein did.

> * Where else is this concept or principle applicable?
>
> * What is the relationship between these two concepts? 

Asking these questions can help us actively establish connections between neurons and improve our ability to integrate understanding.

If we do this often, we can establish principles, and the core of these principles can be very simple, and can be clearly explained in a single sentence. For example, pursue simple principles, simple strategies, simple methods, and simple logic, this is our ultimate methodology for solving problems and understanding the world. Teaching is the best learning, this is the ultimate methodology of learning. Every success depends on accumulation, this is the ultimate methodology of doing things.
