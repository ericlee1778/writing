We've all heard the saying, "personality determines destiny." This statement is undoubtedly profound, but do you really understand what "personality" is?

On Wikipedia, personality might be defined as an individual's long-term behavioral and emotional response patterns. This definition sounds both universal and vague, lacking in practical guidance. This raises a question: how does such a vague concept determine our destiny? Or rather, why should we let such a vague concept dictate our fate?

First, let's look at some basic characteristics of personality.

Personality is not set in stone at birth. Your personality as a child may differ from your personality as an adult. Personality can be changed through acquired learning, cognition, and experiences. For instance, a person may initially be reckless, but after undergoing certain experiences, they may become more cautious.

Cognitive psychology has a theory, ***["Information Processing Theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing)***. It suggests that when humans receive external stimuli, they process the information received. We can view the human brain as a complex responding machine.

When babies are born, they have no personality or thoughts. They are like simple responding machines, with only two types of behaviors, or what we can call [response patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior): crying and sleeping. They don't even feel tired or hungry; when they're tired, they sleep, and when they're hungry, they cry. As babies grow, they begin to think, imitate others' expressions and actions, and develop curiosity about the world around them. Their response patterns become more diverse, no longer limited to crying and sleeping. Their thoughts and behaviors begin to be influenced by the external world.

What we call "personality" is really just a collection of various response patterns.

There's a parenting technique that suggests that when a child throws a tantrum, parents should not readily fulfill their demands. One important aspect is that parents need to stay beside the child, calmly waiting until their emotions have been fully expressed, and then hold and comfort them.

The second point of this technique is that when the child is laughing, parents should reward them. This way, parents can foster good response patterns in children, so they don't throw tantrums when they want something. When children want something, they won't cry or fuss because they know it doesn't work. Instead, they'll try to make their parents happy to get what they want.

However, they gradually realize that not every smile or act of pleasing will work. This makes the child start seeking other ways to get what they want, like using their own pocket money to buy it, or trading with classmates. Through this process, they start to develop a concept:

> *You can't always get what you want, and sometimes it's okay not to.*

When they understand the relationship between value and trade, they start to cultivate their own values.

So-called "values" are a recognition of "what is more important than what, and what is most important."

However, some people still act like babies in their thinking and behavior as adults. We call these people ["Giant infant"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_infant) because their response patterns remain at the level of infancy.

Let's summarize:

Personality is not predestined at birth. Personality can be changed through acquired learning and experiences. Personality is a collection of various response patterns. These response patterns can be beneficial or harmful.

From our previous analysis and reasoning, we've shifted the definition of personality to response patterns, a definition that's clearer, less vague, and instructive.

The conclusion is: good response patterns can change destiny. So, how can we cultivate good response patterns?

Based on our previous analysis, good response patterns can form good values. So, what determines these values?

Given our definition of values, we can draw the answer:

> ***Values are determined by our choices.***

In the process of forming good values, all we do is think and constantly compare what's more important than what, and what's most important, to make better choices.

In every chapter, we are updating the foundational concepts of cognition. These concepts are updating and upgrading our cognitive operating system, helping us make better judgments and thereby better choices, leading to better values.

Therefore, we can conclude:

> ***The cultivation of response patterns is the process of learning and practicing various correct concepts and principles.***

These correct concepts and principles ultimately determine our destiny, and this process of determining destiny is described by others with the vague concept: *personality*; while we use a clearer, more instructive concept: *response patterns*.
