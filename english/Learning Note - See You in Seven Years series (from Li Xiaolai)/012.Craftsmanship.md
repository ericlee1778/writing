## From Learning to Skill

Acquiring a skill is a long-term commitment. Naturally, doing something well requires a significant investment of time and attention span.

Crossing boundaries between skills and knowledge is vital, with many breakthroughs resulting from such interdisciplinarity.

However, this does not mean that learning as much as possible and diversifying is a sound strategy.

To reach a level of usefulness and value recognized by the market, a skill needs to meet a baseline. We can think of this as a cost line.

Our investment is the cost, and the value generated from our investment is our return. Only when the return exceeds the cost do we achieve net income.

We must increase efficiency and perform a task well enough to benefit from it. However, our time and attention span are limited. Only by choosing a few things and doing them exceptionally well can we reap greater benefits. This is the so-called expertise.

## From Skill to Expertise

Once we understand the importance of expertise, we can draw a conclusion. Like us, others are also focusing on developing their expertise. Many people have the same expertise as us, and everyone is chasing the same resources, which leads to fierce competition due to supply and demand.

Only by outperforming the majority can we benefit. Otherwise, we may be replaced by others. This might be why we can't escape from comparative mentality. This comparative mentality is prevalent, unaffected by will, as it's a part of human nature.

Although those of us practicing a growth mindset have learned to compare ourselves only to our past selves and not others, we can't avoid others actively comparing themselves to us. They may employ various tactics to undermine us. If we and they are on par in one dimension, they might attack us in another. Office politics is a typical example.

This can be frustrating. If we try to compete with them in another dimension, it inevitably diverts our scarce attention span and time, hindering our growth. Ignoring them often results in annoyance and emotional distress. How can we resolve this dilemma?

Firstly, let's ponder a question: Would you compare yourself to a top leader in your field? Probably not, as the gap is too large, making comparison meaningless. How did these top leaders reach their height? Were they all born perfect, unbeatable from birth? This is obviously not the case.

In reality, former top leaders and current us face similar predicaments. However, you only see a handful of successful top leaders. The others didn't make it, and the reasons behind this deserve our contemplation.

Follow the logic here: people don't compare themselves to top leaders because top leaders are on a higher level. Because we're not top leaders, we're trapped in comparison.

From the reasoning above, we can conclude that if our expertise isn't deep enough, others will continue to compare themselves to us.

This is a very instructive discovery, as it essentially informs us how to break through the predicament.

We need to strive harder for growth, distancing ourselves quicker from those trying to surpass us at every turn.

While others disperse their attention span, we continue to accumulate and grow. As the gap in the time spent on accumulation between us and them widens, an inevitable outcome will occur: 

> ***We are completely detached from them. Because the gap is too large, they stop comparing themselves to us and find others to compete with.***

Therefore, everything is a result of accumulation. This deeply expertise that leaves others in the dust, we can call it ***craftsmanship***.

## From Expertise to Craftsmanship

Why is it called craftsmanship? It is something we create with our hands that, at least for most people, is impossible to replicate. This thing exists because of you. Without you, it wouldn't exist, bringing us tremendous satisfaction.

There's a Chinese saying, "agile mind makes for nimble hands" In fact, it's not that the mind is agile so the hand is nimble, but rather the hand becomes nimble, making the mind more agile, which in turn makes the hand more nimble. They don't have a simple cause-and-effect relationship, but rather mutually reinforce each other.

Everything is about accumulation. With enough practice, you naturally figure out the tricks. These tricks may seem commonplace to us, like eating a meal, but are completely inscrutable to outsiders.

Craftsmanship means that although you think you've mastered something, when you try it yourself, you realize the result is vastly different from what a craftsman produces. This is like cooking, woodworking, carving, musical performance, etc. Actually, all abilities are the same: they seem ordinary but god is in the details.

Craftsmanship is named as such because it produces works. Or we can call them creations. Craftsmanship means creating an object. When we can create, it greatly impacts us, making us increasingly confident, manifesting growth mindset characteristics, and strengthening our courage. We also become more patient in our tasks. These works are the products of these qualities, and as we create, we also grow.

Initially, we can only imitate or adapt others' works. But once we become craftsmen, we can create works of our own. These creations don't necessarily have to change the world. They could be a recipe we wrote, a song we composed, a software program, a book, a painting, etc.

What is a "common person"? A common person doesn't know how to create things, can't create things, and never creates things.

We can also draw another conclusion. If you want your child to excel when they grow up, you first need to learn how to create things. If parents can create things, their children are more likely to be able to create things, or even surpass their parents.

Children are influenced by what they see and hear; role model is always the best education. Parents should first set an example for their children. Children grow up by observing their parents, and children are indoctrinated to think and behave in ways that they imitate from their parents, and they come to believe that those thoughts and behaviors are reasonable.

Whoever we are, we should learn to create our own things. These things exist because of us. Without us, they wouldn't exist. And it's best if these things can bring value to others. If so, this will bring immense satisfaction to our lives.
