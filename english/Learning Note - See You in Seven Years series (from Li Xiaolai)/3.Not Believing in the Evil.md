# Unveiling "Not Believing in the Evil" — A Deep Analysis of Human Evil, Conspiracy Theories, and Social Progress

Concept of this chapter: Not Believing in the Evil

*The content of this chapter comes from Li Xiaolai's video sharing in 2020-08 on the topic "Not Believing in the Evil" in the series "See You in Seven Years".*

---

**Believing in the Evil** — has two layers of meaning:

> * Many people choose to believe in baseless things such as fallacies, conspiracy theories, and superstitions.
>
> * Many people choose to believe that human nature is evil, believing that doing evil things is more rewarding and successful than doing good things.
>
***Whether in Eastern or Western societies, people generally "believe in the evil".***

We may have all heard something like this:

> People who make a lot of money must have done a lot of bad things.

This is a typical example of "believing in the evil".

## Why do people generally "believe in the evil"?

Many people in life believe in superstitions, such as astrology, numerology, feng shui, and so on. Especially when difficulties arise in life and people can't find the reasons and solutions, they start to believe in these superstitions, essentially giving up on thinking for themselves.

We also shouldn't "believe in the evil" when doing things. Those with iniquitous behavior will eventually fail because the laws of the world operate differently from most people's perceptions. By adhering to good principles, we are actually protected. As long as we act according to the good principles, we don't have to worry about evil happening around us.

There is a widely circulated belief that ***"the righteous path is full of hardship"***, that the righteous path is hard to follow, so many people choose the evil path. They think, "Everyone else is doing it, so it won't matter if I join in." However, the righteous path is not filled with hardship.

> *The night after I finished writing this article, I had a dream in which my best friend from primary school kept playing pranks on me. I was furious, almost exploding with anger, and my mind was filled with thoughts of beating him severely to ease my hatred. But the moment my consciousness suddenly woke up, I realized that violence wouldn't solve the problem. Instead, it could lead me into bigger trouble. The best solution was actually to completely cut off all relationship and refuse to cooperate with him in the future.*
>
> *This way, he would no longer be able to gain any benefits from me, unable to trade with me, unable to get my support, losing someone who sincerely treated him. What could be a more cruel punishment than this? Furthermore, the stronger we become, the more we can choose who we work with, meaning we won't be forced to cooperate with people we don't like.*

The righteous path is not full of hardship. As you follow down the righteous path, you'll find the road widening, quickening your pace. At the same time, the likelihood of encountering good people increases because those who have reached the same height as you have certainly understood this principle.

In the process of making money, we should not "believe in the evil" even more. The most evil way of making money is undoubtedly Ponzi schemes, which usually operate as pyramid schemes with no product value, relying entirely on by acquiring new victims. Everyone knows it's a Ponzi scheme, but everyone thinks they won't be the last unlucky ones. However, from a statistics perspective, this kind of mindset is clearly illogical.

## Why is it actually more profitable to be a good person?

We need to believe that the world is getting better and better. In this improving world, it's becoming more profitable to be a good person. The consequences of doing bad things compared to the benefits are obviously not worth it. Moreover, being a good person can also make money, and the money earned is more long-lasting. A clear sign that the world is getting better is that it's becoming easier for good people to make money. In this era, there are more and more opportunities for knowledge to create wealth.

With the advancement of technology, our average life expectancy is also increasing. This means that we have a long time to live after retirement. If we can live to 100, then after retiring at 60, we still have 40 years to live the life we want. Since we can live longer, we must not "believe in the evil", do the right things, live the right life, and achieve legitimate success.

In the past, there were so many bad people because the average life expectancy was short, and many times, good people didn't have time to wait for the long-term effects of doing good things. Therefore, they could only hope for karma, believing that it's just a matter of time that bad people will eventually get their comeuppance. But now, with our average life expectancy constantly increasing and the advancement of technology increasing the probability of evil things being discovered, evil things committed a few years ago may be exposed a few years later.

On the contrary, if we do the right things, even though we can't see the benefits in the short term, from a long-term perspective, the benefits will definitely be enormous. Moreover, because the average life expectancy is constantly increasing, we will certainly live to an age where we can see and enjoy these benefits.

## You can choose what to believe

The future is unknown, and the world could potentially get worse, such as wars, hyperinflation, banking system collapse, etc. You can also choose to believe that human life expectancy will not significantly increase. If this is our future, then the conclusion that it's more profitable to be a good person than a bad one might be wrong, because this is based on the premise that the world is getting better and our average life expectancy is constantly increasing.

What does this understanding of the world do for us? Should we do bad things just because the world might get worse? Or should we do nothing, give up on growing, just because it's hard to be a good person, it's hard to follow the right path, it's hard to do the right thing, and it's hard to live a decent life?

Or, the world might also get better, like the prevalence of artificial intelligence, near-free renewable energy, the merging of reality and virtuality, breakthroughs in biotechnology, and so on. As we keep growing, the world is getting better, our lifespan is increasing, and our previous choices will lead us to greater benefits in that era.

Even if the future world is not good enough, we will become stronger because of our growth and better adapt to changes in the environment.

## Why people believe weird things

There's a very interesting TED Talk, titled [Why people believe weird things | Michael Shermer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T_jwq9ph8k)

Although it's not directly related to the core of this article, I still highly recommend that everyone watch it because it's very interesting and enlightening. In this talk, the speaker humorously shows us how people believe in strange things without any evidence.
