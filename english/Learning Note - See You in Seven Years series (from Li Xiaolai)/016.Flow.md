# Unlocking Your Potential: A Comprehensive Guide to Finding and Achieving Flow

Concept of this chapter: Flow

*The content of this chapter comes from Li Xiaolai's video sharing in 2021-09 on the topic "Flow" in the series "See You in Seven Years".*

In previous chapters, we discussed [Personality](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/013.Personality.md), which is the result of many response patterns interacting with each other. Our personality is not entirely innate but gradually formed throughout our lives and can change. In terms of actual personality impact, innate factors are negligible compared to the personality developed later in life.

For instance, we discussed [Optimism](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/014.Optimism.md) and [Introspection](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/015.Introspection.md) before, both skills that are acquired later in life and can influence personality. This also includes some qualities, like courage, which have a significant impact on our personality and success.

On the path to success, two qualities can be named as the most fundamental and crucial:

> * [**Courage**](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/010.Courage.md)
> * **Patience**

They form the foundation of achieving any kind of success. Patience allows us to concentrate and polish our skills undisturbed. Courage enables us to remain resilient in the face of setbacks, pushing forward. These two qualities also reflect the spirit of long-term thinking.

This perspective can be extended to a concept we've mentioned many times in previous chapters:

> **_“Everything is achieved through accumulation.”_**

In the chapter on [Craftsmanship](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/012.Craftsmanship.md), we mentioned that we need to spend a significant amount of time to become proficient at a skill. This is also a characteristic of long-term thinking. However, although most people understand and accept these truths, and even agree with them wholeheartedly, they can't put them into practice. Why is that? The answer is simple:

> _**They lack patience.**_

This leads us to the topic we'll discuss today: **Flow**.

## Flow

[Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), or immersion, is a psychological state describing humans entirely immersed and invested in an activity.

What is the relationship between flow and patience?

Flow is like the raw material of patience. The longer we invest in a task, the better we get at it, and our patience grows accordingly.

We can categorize flow into two types: **Useless** and **Useful**.

Useless flow includes watching TikTok videos or playing video games. You might notice when people are immersed in these activities, they enter a fully immersed, selfless devotion state. Their attention is entirely focused on the screen content, disregarding everything around them. In such a state, they don't even notice the scratches on the phone screen or its frame.

Apps like TikTok are designed brilliantly. When users enter the app, the status bar at the top and bottom of the screen disappears, making it easier for users to be captivated by the short videos.

The same happens with games. When we're immersed, we don't even realize we're controlling the game panel, controlling the in-game character. This is similar to driving, where signaling, checking the rear-view mirror, turning, accelerating all happen seamlessly. Just as you are the car, and the car is you; you are the game character, and the game character is you. That's why some people smash keyboards or throw mouse when playing games: because it really hurts when things go wrong!

Examples of useful flow are reading books or exercising. When we're immersed in reading, we're fully engaged in understanding and contemplating the contents, forgetting that we're holding a book or e-reader. Similarly, when we're immersed in exercising, we don't even feel tired and sometimes even enter a meditation-like state.

When we fully understand flow, we realize that the core differences between people lie in:

1. How much time do we spend in flow each day?
2. Do we actively immerse ourselves in useful things?

In fact, these two questions can be combined into one: _**How long do we actively immerse ourselves in useful things each day?**_

Flow is the raw material for patience, because when we actively enter a state of flow, we can spend a long time doing seemingly dull and boring things, and find pleasure in them. With such experiences accumulated, we can more easily enter a state of flow when doing other things, making it easier to persevere in the long run. To others, we seem patient, persevering, and focused. But in reality, this is merely an outward manifestation of flow. A similar concept was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter on introspection:

> _Sometimes, we find that when some people look at us, we feel as if their gaze can see through us, reaching further. We call such a gaze profound, but essentially, this is an outward manifestation of the ability of introspection._

Once we master the ability to immerse ourselves, we can continuously progress and grow. Because everything is the result of accumulation. If a person spends 4 hours each day on the same thing, they dedicate 1,460 hours to it in a year. In less than 7 years, they've invested 10,000 hours. If someone invests 10,000 hours in something, there's no way they can't be an expert, there's no way they can't do a good job.. Such people inevitably have cultivated patience and focus during the process.

So, how can we gradually extend our active immersion time?

## Strategies to Increase Active Flow

### Improve Sleep Quality

Improving sleep quality can give us more energy and focus when we're awake, making it easier to enter a state of flow. The most effective way to ensure sleep quality is through exercise. After our body has been sufficiently exercised, we naturally have better sleep quality at night.

### Find Something Meaningful and Immersive to Do

This could be any hobby or something you find meaningful. It could be learning a new language, practicing a sport, or researching a technology. Often, we're not lacking in attention, but we spend it on useless things, leaving no spare attention to actively immerse in useful activities. If there are one or two meaningful things worth doing, we'll consciously avoid wasting time on useless things, because we realize we never have enough time for meaningful tasks.

## Conclusion

> **_Replace passive flow with active flow_**

Find meaningful things to replace meaningless and energy-consuming tasks, and actively immerse yourself in them.

Everything depends on accumulation, just as mileage is inseparable from driver's skills and experience. The longer the time spent in active flow, the stronger the ability; the stronger the active flow ability, the easier it is to enter a state of active flow, no matter what we're doing.

When we spend time on meaningful things and reduce time spent on meaningless ones, it's as if we're concentrating our attention, focusing on the right things.
