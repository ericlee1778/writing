# Asking for Help: Courage or Weakness?

Is asking for help from others really a bad behavior? Do we always advocate that we should independently handle everything, fearing to bring trouble to others? Is such a way of life truly reasonable?

In our life, sometimes we face some problems or difficulties, some can be solved by ourselves, while others require help from others.

So, what should we do when we need others' help?

> * Ask others for help?
> * Stubbornly tough it out and try to solve it on our own?

Some people believe that asking for help is incompetence, a form of weakness, a kind of dependency. They think that independence is a good quality, and when encountering difficulties, one should face it alone and solve the problem independently. I used to hold this kind of thinking towards asking for help.

## What is the Nature of Asking for Help?

Let's look at the following questions:

> * When we ask others for help, what are their real thoughts?
>
> * If we do not ask for help when we should, what will the other party think?

We often fear bothering others, disturbing them, so we do not seek help from them. But:

> * Do they really dislike us bothering them?
>
> * Or do they care more about how we view them?

## Reflecting on My Experience of Asking for Help

Something happened recently, my family and relatives stayed in a guesthouse after attending a wedding banquet. I shared a room with my cousin brother and his friend, while my mother, my relatives, and my cousin sister stayed in another room. That night, I unfortunately suffered food poisoning, woke up in the middle of the night, vomiting, unbearably painful. I had two choices:

> * Either bear it silently until dawn, then ask my mother or others take me to the clinic, so as not to disturb everyone's sleep;
>
> * Or immediately tell my mother or others, ask them take me to the clinic.

I weighed the cost and benefit again and again, if I choose to wait until dawn to tell them, would they really be happy that I didn't disturb them? Or would they feel upset because I didn't seek their help at the first moment?

They might think:

> What kind of persons are we in your mind, relatives or strangers? Why are you afraid to bother us?

Then there is another question, should I go directly to my mother, or first seek help from my cousin brother and his friend who are staying in the same room as me? If I directly go to my mother, they wake up and find out that I did not ask for their help, how would they think, and how would they view themselves?

They might think:

> * Are we in your mind someone who can't be asked for help?
>
> * Why didn't you tell us when you were in such unbearable pain, letting us sleep until dawn?

For these two questions, we can think for ourselves, if someone else encounters similar difficulties and when they need help, do we hope:

> * They ask for our help;
>
> * Or, despite the difficulties, they choose to solve it on their own, or seek help from others, so as not to disturb us?

After deep thought, I made what I think is the most correct choice: I immediately sought help from my cousin brother and his friends. The fact proved that I didn't upset anyone, on the contrary, I could even feel that our relationship became closer because of this.

## The Nature of Seeking Help

Let's look at seeking help from a different angle. When we truly need someone's help, we ask for it, and when they indeed assist us, they feel they have provided us with value. This significantly contributes to enhancing their satisfaction and happiness in life.

Conversely, when we refrain from seeking help from others out of fear of bothering them, they do not derive happiness from our goodwill upon discovering this. Instead, they might feel upset and uncomfortable because they feel unworthy of being sought for help. This could potentially harm their self-esteem. According to [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), esteem needs are of a higher order, even higher than social needs.

We can ponder over this question:

> How does it feel when we are willing to help others, but they are reluctant to let us assist?

This reminds me of an article I wrote before, "[Value](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/002.Value.md)". The core idea of the article is that the judgment of value is determined by the receiver. In that article, I discussed many ways to provide value to others, and this food poisoning experience made me think more deeply about how to let others extract value from us. This article is an extension of this thought, exploring how to let others derive value from us.

The feature of these two aspects is that when you provide value to others, you are the giver, and the others are the receivers of value. When others derive value from us, they are the givers, and they are also the receivers of value.

Whether we provide value to others or seek help from others, as long as it creates value, it is meaningful. When we help others, they get help and we get satisfaction; conversely, when we let others help us, we get help, and they get satisfaction. This is a mutually beneficial process.

This realization made me recognize anew that seeking help from others when we need it is not a shameful act, but rather a process of value creation.

I recall a story I once read. A father asked his child to pick fruit from a tree, but the child couldn't climb trees and was too short to reach the fruit, no matter how hard he jumped. Finally, the child told his father that he had tried his best but could not pick the fruit. The father responded to the child, "You didn't try your best because you didn't ask me for help."

Asking for help is not a sign of incompetence, weakness, or dependence. Seeking help is actually a skill, wisdom, and courage. When we master this ability, we can better complete our work and life. This is why in a team, teamwork is the most important, and the performance of the team as a whole far outweighs the outstanding performance of individuals. This not only applies to the business sector but also to the field of competitive sports.

## The Methodology of Seeking Help

Seeking help is a skill, so how can we do it better?

I believe the following points are crucial:

> 1. You should prepare yourself, think clearly about what kind of help you need from the other person, and then clearly tell them.
>
> 2. Do not say things like: "It's okay if you can't help me."
>
> 3. Don't make excuses for the difficulties you encounter to ease the embarrassment.
>
> 4. Accept others' help with a heart full of gratitude, not guilt.

The other party may not know how to help us best. They are actually afraid that they might make things worse. Therefore, clearly telling them what kind of help we need is very important.

Many people are not good at asking for help from others, even though they may often seek help from others. They ask for help from others with a guilty mentality, resulting in their behavior appearing strange.

They may be afraid of bothering others, so they say something like "It's okay if you don't help,". In fact, if the other party really can't provide help, they will tell us, and we don't need to remind them. When we say this, they might feel more embarrassed and pressured.

When asking for help, we often make a mistake by liking to explain. In order to ease our inner embarrassment, we will find some excuses to explain that this difficulty is accidental and not within our control. This makes it easy for people to associate our explanation with the following subtext:

> * If it's not a big deal, I wouldn't bother you specifically.
>
> * Don't worry, after you help me solve the problem, I'll leave immediately and won't bother you anymore.

Interestingly, after most people seek assistance and express gratitude, they really leave quickly. This is actually seeking help from others with a sense of guilt. The problem is not whether to leave immediately after seeking help because you can reciprocate the other party at any time. What matters is a change in mentality. If you ask for help from others with a sense of guilt, it will give them inexplicable pressure and make them feel uncomfortable. As they might ask themselves:

> Is asking help from me make you so embarrassing?
