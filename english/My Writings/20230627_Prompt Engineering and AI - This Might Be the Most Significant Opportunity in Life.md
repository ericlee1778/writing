# Prompt Engineering and AI: This Might Be the Most Significant Opportunity in Life

For me, this might be the most important article I've ever written. Why do I consider it significant? Because it involves my own life experiences, it is the process by which I gradually moved from chaos and confusion to order, and it is my understanding and observation of learning and growth. For you, I believe it will be incredibly enlightening.

First, let me backtrack to my childhood. I was not a clever student then, and even faced two major crossroads in my life due to poor academic performance. However, I consider myself very fortunate to have had these two experiences, because without them, my life might have taken a different trajectory.

---

### Primary School Experience

Let's start with my primary school experience. Back then, I performed very poorly in the Malay language in the [UPSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School_Achievement_Test_(Malaysia%29) mock exam. The fear, the dreadâ€”I remember it vividly even today. At that time, I wanted to align myself with my peers as much as possible, not wanting to have to spend an extra year in a foundational class (when going to secondary school) because of my poor grades, while others could directly enter middle school. This was something I couldn't accept.

Upon learning of my grades, my mother didn't blame me. Instead, she quietly took me from one tuition center to another, hoping to find a place that could assure my pass in Malay in a short time. I was very weak at that time, unable to make the decision to change my fate independently. I feel very fortunate to have had a mother who could lend a hand and offer support when I was most confused and helpless.

When the results were announced, my expectation became a reality. As I had guessed, only a very few students in the class were admitted to the foundational class. For me, I did not do very well, just barely passing. Despite this, it was the first time that I vaguely realized that learning could change one's fate. The idea wasn't very clear, but it planted a seed in my mind.

### Secondary School Experience

Reflecting on my secondary school period, history repeated itself. This time, it was my history subject in the Lower Secondary Assessment mock exam that was disastrous. This implied that I hadn't learned much from my primary school experience and hadn't become more diligent. This was to be expected because the motivation derived from fear is temporary and unsustainable. If we rely on fear to force ourselves to progress, we will quickly return to square one. This can lead to a sense of defeat, eroding our confidence, hindering our next attempt, and depriving us of the courage to take on new challenges. This hesitation between wanting to do something but not daring to will plunge us into despair.

Facing this setback in secondary school, my internal thought was:

> "Again?"

I felt utterly hopeless that the same thing was happening to me again. This failure came without any warning, as my history grades had always been passable in the exams prior to the mock exam.

Fortunately, due to my experience in primary school, I had gained some experience. This time, I was able to choose how to make a change. Although still very desperate, I thought about it for an afternoon and then asked my mother to take me to the bookstore, where we bought past year exam papers for history. My mother, upon learning that I had failed in history subject, didn't blame me. Like before, she silently supported me, with not a word of reprimand. She just took me to buy books.

During that time, I received considerable assistance. Three months before the final exam, an excellent teacher joined my tuition center, who helped us review three years of secondary school history subjects. This time the result was much more satisfactory than in primary school. My history grade rose from a fail to an excellent 'A' grade. After this experience, I never encountered similar troubles again. I guess that's because these two successes gave me confidence and made me realize that learning has techniques and that learning itself is a skill that needs cultivation.

### University Experience

Next, let me talk about my university experience. During my university years, something happened that changed my life. One day, a professor asked us in class about our goals for the final exam. When it was my turn, I bragged that my goal was to achieve the highest grades in all my subjects. The whole class burst into applause because nobody had ever made such a bold statement before. I was very nervous when I said it; in fact, I didn't believe I could do it.

However, this commitment planted a seed in my heart. My subconscious kept telling me that I must fulfill this promise. Even though no one would probably remember or pay attention to that episode, I started to take it seriously! Although I didn't achieve the highest grade at the end, the results were pretty good. Among the entire grade level, my performance could be ranked in the top 10% or even the top 5%. Since then, my academic grades have always been excellent, consistently at the top level.

### Post-University

After graduating from university, I started a habit: writing. Counting both publicly published and privately written pieces, I've written nearly 40 articles. Compared to those who have been writing for a long time, my quantity is not substantial. However, the content of my public articles share a characteristic: they contain truths I firmly believe in and are products of my genuine thought process. To me, if even I am not convinced by the concept presented in my article, it doesn't warrant being published.

To me, writing is a form of effective learning, much like doing past year exam papers. It is both a way of learning and a means of outputting knowledge. Just like if we practice more exam questions, we can better understand the exam content and achieve better grades. Learning can be divided into two forms:

> * Input
> * Output

Input is a passive form of learning. Only through continuous practice, enabling us to output what we've learned, can we better understand and master it.

Beginning my journey into writing with this mindset, I discovered an interesting fact, and later, a related scientific methodology, the Feynman Learning Method:

> Teaching is the best way to learn.

And the advanced method is:

> We can use what we've learned to create a new product.

This is also the effective learning methodology I realized during my coding journey. Many industry leaders also share this method for learning and doing things.

For instance, if you want to learn programming, after mastering some basic knowledge of coding, you should try to create a product. The product doesn't need to be complex; most of the time, you might be the only one using it. The product might not be very useful to others. For example, you can optimize your work flow through programming, instead of staying in a passive state of learning programming knowledge.

Now, we have ChatGPT. For the second time in my life, I have deeply felt that this is a tremendous opportunity. This is an opportunity that has no wealth and class barriers, and it could change the fate of ordinary people, allowing them to make leaps and bounds in their lives.

### The Huge Opportunity Brought by ChatGPT

A few months ago, I started using ChatGPT. Although it shocked me greatly, I didn't realize at the time that this was a tremendous opportunity. I only vaguely felt that I should delve into ChatGPT but didn't take real action. At that time, I was acting out of fear of lagging behind others. As I mentioned earlier, such actions are driven by fear, not by a genuine understanding of the great opportunity that ChatGPT presents, so it cannot last.

At that time, I also lacked the courage to learn ChatGPT. Yes, you heard right, learning requires courage, even for someone like me who is good at learning. Although this industry is still developing, many people are already at the forefront of it, and new AI applications are being implemented in real life every day. Just observing these novelties made me feel powerless because I knew that most people, including me, don't have enough time and attention span to catch up with these new things.

In addition, I vaguely felt that prompt engineering might not be a skill that could make a good money for ordinary people like me. Because all prompts can be publicly shared, and the cost of sharing is nearly zero. It's likely that only the top-notch prompt engineers can make big money. So, what can we ordinary people do after learning it?

I also noticed the threat that generative AI poses to us. This threat is real; it is very likely to replace many people's jobs. Moreover, the synergy between different technologies will cause many technologies to suddenly surge in their development.

Imagine, Generative Artificial Intelligence (like ChatGPT) + Augmented Reality AR (like Apple Vision Pro) is comparable to a inferior version of the end product of Neuralink already being on the market, AI can use AR to guide us on how to act in the moment we receive information. AI + robotics is also very powerful, like a highly intelligent humanoid robot. Think about it, when AI has a human body, it's like breaking through the virtual world and coming to the physical world. Whatever people can do, AI can do too, and it can do it even better.

So, in such a world, what can ordinary people do? No matter how we struggle, we will eventually be replaced, be eliminated. Maybe we should give up resistance early and just [lying flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping#:~:text=Tang%20ping%20can%20be%20considered,of%20a%20nascent%20Chinese%20counterculture.).

However, what changed my mind and made me choose to actively learn prompt engineering? I hope to document the process of this mindset transformation not only to help and encourage others but also to strengthen my own beliefs.

Initially, I was inspired by a tweet. Regrettably, I didn't save this tweet, and now I can't find it. But I remember it mainly talked about the author's personal experiences and why we should learn AI as early as possible. A few years ago, when he started learning machine learning, the field was just beginning to develop, and there weren't many people in the industry. He and a group of friends would share and learn together regularly on the Meetup platform, learning a little new thing every day. A few years later, he found that he had learned so much that ordinary people found it hard to keep up. They had followed the industry's development from the beginning and eventually became industry leaders. He believes that learning AI will be the same. If we start learning now, we can keep up with the development pace more easily and progress with the industry.

Later on, I was inspired by a free course from OpenAI called [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/).

This course broadened my horizons and showed me many applications of prompt engineering and its future prospects. If we can correctly grasp the techniques of prompt engineering, we can create highly valuable products. This is not just another product created through a programming language that only executes commands according to the code. This is a product that has the ability to think. We use prompts to tell the AI the principles we hope it will follow. Once the AI understands these principles, we let it make judgments and decisions based on the principles we set. Prompt engineering can be seen as another dimension of software engineering that endows code with autonomous thinking ability, and from the current perspective, the barriers of entry of prompt engineering is not that high, compare with machine learning.

In our interaction with AI, we're continually providing "prompts." These prompts serve as teaching aids, helping AI understand our requirements and expectations. This is like an "invisible programming"â€”we don't write code directly to control the behavior of the AI, but we guide it through "prompts."

And when we can proficiently carry out prompt engineering, we can use AI more effectively and create products and services that better meet our needs. This is a huge opportunity for us.

The third comes from a concept I recently relearned â€“ the growth mindset. We can choose to believe that future jobs will be replaced by machines and embrace the fear of its arrival, or we can choose to believe and optimistically view the future value of artificial intelligence (AI) and prompt engineering. In reality, every industry, every company, might need professional prompt engineers to optimize operations and improve efficiency. And what truly needs optimizing are usually the problems requiring fine-tuning into a customized solutions, which cannot be solved by any ready-made prompt found online.

Just like data analysts, one of the possible specializations for future prompt engineers might involve using prompts to guide models in data analysis. We can choose to believe the first scenario, but it doesn't offer any guidance for our growth. What's really important is that prompt engineering is undoubtedly a vital skill for the future. The conclusion is that we can choose to believe that learning it is definitely the right thing to do.

The fourth comes from an open-source project I saw on GitHub, called [Mr. Ranedeer AI Tutor](https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor). It's an outstanding work by a university student. The core of this project is to train the artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT, into a personalized teacher, which can adapt to our depth of learning, teaching methods, communication styles, and tones to teach us any knowledge we wish to learn. Moreover, it can test us by asking questions, forcing us to output what we've learned.

What does it actually mean?

It allows us not only to choose teachers, but also to change teachers, to tailor our study plans according to our pace, to ask questions at any time without being ignored or disliked, and to take tests anytime. This learning mode is undoubtedly superior to traditional educational methods. In the near future, teachers might no longer directly teach students, but guide and correct them on the side as they use AI auxiliary tools for learning, just like a fitness coach watches your training and corrects you when you make mistakes.

Through an in-depth study of this project, I realized the profound potential of prompt engineering. In the future, a valuable prompt will most likely not be a simple combination of a few sentences. The complexity of truly valuable prompts can be comparable to complete software programming. This field is not monopolized by a few elites. Even non-top prompt engineers have the opportunity to earn their share from this market.

The fifth is when I used this product to learn prompt engineering, I gained a deeper understanding. I suddenly found that we can improve our ability to write prompts through prompt engineering, which was a revelation. As we write better prompts, we can write better prompts to ask ChatGPT to write better prompts for us, creating a virtuous cycle. Moreover, each prompt optimization will receive timely feedback, thereby significantly boosting our learning efficiency in the iterative process.

#### Why Did I Write This Article?

You might ask why I wrote this article? Because I want to openly set my goal as I did in college, even if it might not attract attention from others:

> To become a Prompt Engineer

I know that once I make it public, I'll take this decision more seriously and fulfill my commitment.

#### A Summary of Learning Methods for Prompt Engineering

I want to share some methods for learning prompt engineering.

> 1. Pay attention to industry leaders, read their own or shared academic research and articles. When our own information channels have not yet been established, tracking their updates is the most effective way to obtain information.
>
> 2. Learn new research results, especially those system messages and prompt techniques that have been proven by academia. We can use ChatGPT to test ourselves, ask questions, and stimulate our thinking. We can also have ChatGPT help us optimize our prompts.
>
> 3. Study other people's work and observe how they write prompts. We can learn from others' prompts, make appropriate modifications to suit our needs. We should treat prompts as a programming language to learn.
>
> 4. Output and practice, make some products with prompts. In the process of learning skills, practice is the best learning method. In terms of learning skills, creating products is the best output and practice.
>
> 5. Output and writing, writing is a great way to learn. Through writing, we can share the knowledge and concepts we have learned. In terms of learning knowledge and concepts, writing is the best output.

#### Conclusion

Recently, I've been hesitating whether or not to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus. $20 per month won't impact my quality of life, but I kept asking myself, is it necessary to subscribe just to use ChatGPT-4? Moreover, it's not unlimited â€“ there's a usage limit, which resets every few hours.

However, when I was writing this article, I figured things out. If you want to learn prompt engineering, you definitely need to use the most advanced and best model to learn, future versions of models like ChatGPT-4.5 / ChatGPT-5 will undoubtedly require price. Moreover, the earlier you use advanced models to learn, the higher your learning efficiency will be.

That's also the reason why I chose to focus on ChatGPT, rather than any of the other 100 types of AI. Because in the future, it's likely that one application of ChatGPT could do all the tasks that other 100 generative AIs can do.

As for the possibility of wasting money on subscription, that's not the point we should be focusing on. I think of it this way â€“ the annual subscription fee for ChatGPT Plus is just $240. If I regard this sum as an investment, it's a real bargain compared to the amount and risk I would take investing in the financial market.

I previously wrote an article about 5G and Serendipity. The core idea was that we can only judge whether a thing is worth doing and how right and valuable it is, but we can't predict whether the final outcome will meet our expectations after doing it. We don't even know when the benefits will appear or how they will manifest when we decide to do something. But as long as we stick to this principle â€“ doing the right things in the right way â€“ we'll only get better, and Serendipity will surely come.

I've decided to give myself a year. After a year, I'll look back at my growth and see what changes have taken place in the industry. After a year, I'll summarize my growth and changes in the industry. This is also a commitment I'm making to myself.

See you one year later!
