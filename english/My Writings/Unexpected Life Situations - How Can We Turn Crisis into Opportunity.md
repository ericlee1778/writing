# Unexpected Life Situations: How Can We Turn Crisis into Opportunity?

Unexpected situations always arise. Whether in work, study, or life, we encounter all sorts of sudden events and unexpected incidents. When things are going smoothly, we may feel like everything is under control, with no problems at all. However, once an unexpected event happens, more tend to follow.

So, why does this happen?

> We typically approach tasks with a specific rhythm or routine, system, or steps. When this routine or system is broken, what were originally low-probability occurrences within the system become more likely to happen.

When an unusual event occurs that we're not good at handling, we become more prone to mistakes.

To illustrate, we normally avoid going out in heavy rain. However, when an urgent matter arises, we must go out. After driving out, we find we've forgotten our umbrella. We dash into a nearby store only to realize they don't sell umbrellas, then slip on a waterlogged road because our shoe soles are badly worn. These appear to be a series of accidents, but they may simply occur because we seldom go out in rainy weather, thus we never encounter these rain-related issues.

Unexpected events are unpredictable. We cannot know when they will happen. So, what should we do if something goes wrong, especially when one unexpected event follows another, leaving us unprepared? How can we better handle such situations?

## Methodologies for Handling Unexpected Situations

### Calmness + Patience

We need to be more calm and patient than usual. This is not self-deception, but rather practical. Specifically, we can calm down and tell ourselves that more unexpected events may follow, enabling us to mentally prepare and invest more patience in dealing with the current situation. Then, we can spend more time inspecting, reviewing "Standard Operating Procedures" or mentally retracing the entire incident step by step. This approach helps us avoid discovering mistakes after we thought we have completed the tasks.

Take another example: when running program code, frequent error messages can affect our mood. We may keep modifying some detail and continually trying, but in most cases, the program still returns errors. Another way is to switch to a bigger-picture view to scrutinize the whole code block, or even the entire project, to spot potential errors.

We can ask ourselves some questions, such as, "The program was running properly before, but it's not now. When was the last time it worked properly? What could have happened in between that caused the code to fail?"

Therefore, calmness and patience are not just about maintaining a good mindset, they are strategies for problem-solving. They can help us handle issues better when unexpected situations occur, enhancing our ability to tackle difficulties.

In fact, this strategy of calmness and patience can be applied not only to software engineering but to all aspects of life. Whether it's dealing with complex work tasks or facing challenges in interpersonal relationships, calmness and patience are key to our success.

### Things Eventually Pass, Aren't?

No matter how one unexpected event follows another in life or work, things will eventually pass, aren't? Many of us, when faced with wave after wave of unexpected situations, subconsciously regard this state as eternal, feeling that we will be forever plagued until life's end. Such thinking severely impacts our emotions and leads to mental breakdown. We find it hard to focus on the problem at hand, often making things worse. Then, our emotions spiral out of control, and we begin to give up on ourselves, regretting this later.

However, have you noticed? Even if we choose to give up, things still eventually pass. Problems and unexpected events stop increasing at some point, and we might find some issues resolve themselves without our intervention, or some are not as urgent as we thought. They can wait.

This observation leads to a crucial realization. Since crises eventually pass even if we give up, why should we fear? Once we understand this, we just need to handle one thing according to plan, then the next, then the next. This mindset makes it easier for us to enter a state of flow. When all is dealt with, we discover things were not as bad as they seemed.

Look around and you'll find those who've gone through a lot tend to become more composed. This is because they've gradually understood this truth through repeated experiences.

### Things Are Not as Bad as They Seem

We can also consider the actual impact of an unexpected event, and think about how different the outcome might be if the timing or location were different. Most of the time, the actual results are not the worst-case scenario. On the contrary, we are often lucky. For example, having a car break down in a downpour is a terrible experience no one will deny. But think about it: your car was bound to have a problem one day, and you were about to take a long trip in a few days, wouldn't it be worse to break down on a highway or in a remote unfamiliar area, compared to near your office or home? A breakdown now allows us to fix the problem before embarking on the trip.

Regarding choice, many people believe it corresponds to action, but that's not always the case. Choice can also be a mindset. You can choose to believe what you want to believe. You can choose to remain hopeful and face challenges positively, or you can choose to lay flat and wait for despair. Your choices shape your attitude towards life and mold your world.

### Conclusion

Life is like a mirror, if you smile at it, it smiles back at you. So, remember, no matter what life brings you, no matter how many difficulties you encounter, things will pass. What you need to do is believe in yourself, trust that you can handle anything, and tackle problems one by one. In doing so, you can immerse yourself fully in life, overcome difficulties, and realize things are not that bad. In fact, situations are not as dire as you think, and you are quite lucky. Lastly, remember that you can choose your attitude, you can opt for hope or wait for despair. The choice is yours. Choose the right attitude, and your life will be filled with light.
