# The Big Brother

This is a true story that happened when I was 11 years old. I've been going to this tuition center since I was 7. At 11, there was this one older boy who everyone was scared of. He was a year older than me and always sat in the back. He looked really unfriendly, and even our teacher didn't like him because he didn't do his homework or any assignments.

Thank you for clarifying. I've updated the article to reflect that you joined the tuition center when you were 7 years old and that this story took place when you were 11.

For some reason (i believe it is because I had my first heartbreak during that period,  just after my true first love left the tuition center), I decided to sit next to him one day. He warned me right away: "Don't bother me, or I'll punch you." So, I did what he said and minded my own business, but due to the curiosity, I kept observing what he was doing.

After a few classes, he seemed to soften a bit. From my observation, I learned that he liked drawing and I noticed he was actually really good at drawing. When I told him his drawing was amazing, he looked like he was trying to hold back his joy. He didn't response and say anything, but I could still see from his face and feel that he was really happy.

After that, we sometimes talked about what happened at our day schools. Most of the time, though, we each did our own thing. He started to act like my big brother. If other kids make fun of me, he would scold them. It was like he was protecting me.

Then, one day, he didn't show up. After a few more classes without him, I realized he had left the tuition center for good. By the time of writing this, I wish we could have said goodbye, then it will be a memory more than perfect.

"At the age of 11, I learned something from him: you don't have to excel at academics to be considered a good student. People have different talents, and we shouldn't judge them solely by their surface. He might have looked unfriendly, but when I got to know him, he turned out to be a very warm person."
