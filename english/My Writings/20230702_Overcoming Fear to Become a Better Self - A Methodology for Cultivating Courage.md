# Overcoming Fear to Become a Better Self: A Methodology for Cultivating Courage

On YouTube, we often see people shooting videos that challenge themselves, such as someone listing out ten things they have always been afraid to try, and then bravely facing and challenging these things. One YouTuber, [Mike Shake](https://youtu.be/q3FKgsnC66s), even learned 41 entirely new skills within a year, such as backflip, front flip, drawing a perfect circle, and so on. The common thread in these videos is a spirit of self-challenge and a desire to continuously explore and improve oneself.

When watching these videos, I can't help but recall an article I wrote in the past, the topic of which was [courage](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/english/Learning%20Note%20-%20See%20You%20in%20Seven%20Years%20series%20(from%20Li%20Xiaolai)/010.Courage.md). Whether it is facing fears to challenge oneself or learning completely new skills, both require courage, because we will continually face failure in the process and need to keep trying until we succeed. I have recently been pondering whether we can apply this concept of self-challenge in our daily life to help us cultivate courage?

Previously, we discussed the methodology for cultivating courage: ***overcoming fear*** and ***cultivating a growth mindset***. The principles behind these are indeed the same.

Additionally, we have repeatedly discussed concepts like ***knowing does not mean doing*** and ***practice is the best form of learning***. These two concepts have made me realize that if we truly want to cultivate and enhance courage, merely understanding and knowing is far from enough; only through practice and action can we find the most effective path.

## My Experience with Self-Challenge

Recently, I had an opportunity for self-challenge, which was singing on stage for the first time in my life. I've always thought I have a pretty good skills and have made noticeable progress recently. I wanted an opportunity to test whether I could sing well on stage. Despite my desire to sing on stage, I felt extremely hesitant and fearful. I was afraid that I would forget the lyrics, lose the rhythm and tempo, go off-key, or my voice would crack. I even feared that the accompaniment would be too loud and my voice too soft. In short, I was afraid of not performing well, and afraid of losing face in public.

However, having understanding of the concept of courage, I was able to clearly recognize that these were fears coming from within me. I started to think, if there were no other people in this scenario, would I still be afraid to sing on stage? The answer is obviously no.

I thought about the concept of growth mindset, that is, we only compare ourselves with our former selves. Even if I don't sing well this time, I can learn the lessons so that I can sing better next time. If I don't even dare to go on stage, then I will never know how I perform on stage.

I have noticed a phenomenon since long ago: most people won't pay particular attention to you or remember what you have done; they only care about things related to themselves. Even if you don't perform well, they will forget about it in a day or two. Therefore, being afraid of performing poorly or losing face is entirely unnecessary. Since I'm afraid of not performing well, then the thing I should do is practice.

So, before going on stage, I started to practice repeatedly, memorize the key, do vocal warm-ups, practice the high notes and transitions in the song, and do everything that I could do and prepare in advance. When I was ready, I found that I was no longer nervous or fear, but instead quite excited.

Although I prepared thoroughly, some unexpected incidents still happened after going on stage. The song I chose had both Cantonese and Mandarin versions. I was prepared to sing the Mandarin version, but the staff played the Cantonese version of the accompaniment by mistake. After realizing the error, they tried to select another version, but even after trying twice, the accompaniment was still in Cantonese. This was a system error that the staff couldn't control. Faced with this situation, I thought to myself, this is not the way to go, the song still needs to be sung, so I decided to sing the Mandarin lyrics over the Cantonese accompaniment and finished the entire song. Although there was an accident, I still managed, and I thought I did a decent job.

Before going on stage to sing, I didn't tell anyone that I was going to perform. Interestingly, when I returned to my original seat after stepping down from the stage, those around me hadn't realized that I had just been up on stage singing. Or perhaps some did notice, but didn't say it out. This once again proved my theory that most people don't pay special attention to you or remember what you have done.

## Re-examining the concept of Courage Once Again

This recent experience has led me to revisit a piece I've written in the past, an article entitled [Being Genuine](https://github.com/ericlee1778/writing/blob/main/chinese/%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%20-%20%E7%9B%B8%E7%BA%A6%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%83%E5%B9%B4%20(%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%E7%9D%A1%E8%AF%9D%E7%9A%84%E5%87%BA%E5%A4%84%E7%8E%8B%E7%AC%91%E6%9D%A5%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B)/001.%E4%B8%8D%E8%A3%85.md). The concept was simple: We really don't need to fear others' judgments, we just need to be ourselves.

And I've gradually realized, after having a few experiences where we've managed to overcome our fears, we grow more confident and courageous. The next time we're faced with fear, we can take that first step with more ease, boldly moving forward, because there's really nothing to be afraid of. It was not until this moment that I deeply understood that courage indeed can be cultivated, which means that courage is actually a skill.

So, we can identify things in life that we want to do but are afraid to, such as starting a conversation or talking to strangers. We don't need to let fear hinder our actions. Fear is merely a thought and it doesn't dictate our behavior. Admitting we are afraid doesn't mean we can't muster the courage to do what we believe is right. We can start with small things, and even if we fail, it's okay - we won't lose anything. In this process, we can gradually practice our courage, slowly fostering a growth mindset, and incorporating it as part of our lives. Eventually, we won't need to deliberately think about it or practice, we can naturally switch to the growth mindset way of thinking.
