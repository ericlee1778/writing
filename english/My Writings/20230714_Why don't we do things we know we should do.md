# When Knowing Isn't Enough: Overcoming the Disconnect Between Rationality and Emotion

> _**Why don't we do things we know we should do?**_

---


We all know what we should do, don't we? We're rational creatures. We understand the long-term benefits of actions, yet we hesitate, we stall, we avoid. Here's the crux: while our rational brain or 'System 2' is shouting "Go for it!", our emotional brain or 'System 1' quietly whispers "But what if?". This is the [dual-process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow), a psychological concept illustrating how our two cognitive systems can conflict, leading to inaction or irrational behavior.

The human mind is a complex machinery. It is the arena where two primary forces - rationality and emotion, often termed as System 2 and System 1 respectively, continuously wrestle with each other. This internal conflict is a common theme in our daily life, whether we realize it or not. How many times have you found yourself caught in a battle between what you know you 'should' do and what you 'feel' like doing? The answer is likely countless. So, why don't we do things we know we should do?

We often think rationally, understand the potential long-term benefits of our actions, and yet, we hesitate or avoid doing what we know is right. It's as if there's an emotional barrier preventing us from taking meaningful actions. 

## The Duel of Two Systems

A classic real-world example: switching careers. Rationally, we comprehend that a career change could open doors to more opportunities and overall happiness. Emotionally, we fear uncertainty or are just too comfortable in our current role. We are caught in an emotional tug-of-war. Now, the big question isn't about developing more self-control, but about understanding our emotional barriers.

## Unraveling The Emotional Barrier

In understanding this behavior, it's crucial not to fight against our emotions, but to accept and acknowledge them. The real challenge lies in understanding our emotional barriers and aligning our rational thinking (System 2) and emotional response (System 1). It's not about suppressing one system for the other; instead, it's about creating a harmony where they can collaboratively drive us towards effective action.

This balance, however, is not always easy to achieve. You might find yourself swinging to either extreme, dominated by either rationality or emotion. Let's explore these two scenarios in detail:

### When Rationality Overshadows Emotion

If you are someone who suppresses emotions, viewing them as detrimental to decision-making, you might find yourself continuously chasing goals. You strive for perfection, but you never feel satisfied, fulfilled, or genuinely happy. This endless pursuit can lead to frustration and eventual burnout. Eventually you discovered the uncomfortable truth, you realize that the world doesn't revolve around you and that you cannot fix everything. And the world still doing well even without you. They will be some others can replace you. At the same time, you are not happy, you are not satisfied what you have gotten. So, what is the value and meaning of your life?

If you find yourself in this situation, it's time to reconnect with your emotions. You need to listen to your desires, explore what genuinely makes you happy, and stop chasing goals set by societal expectations. Test the waters, step outside your comfort zone, try different things, and see what resonates with your true self. You need to find a purpose that gives meaning to your actions and discover joy in the process.

For instance, you could explore hobbies or side projects that have always intrigued you. Taking small steps in these areas might ignite a passion that your rational self was suppressing, thus helping balance your emotion and rationality.

### When Emotion Dominates Rationality

On the other extreme, if you let your emotions run wild, you might find yourself continuously chasing pleasures. You jump from one thing to another, seeking instant gratification. In the long run, this lack of focus can lead to dissatisfaction as you realize you haven't mastered any skills or built a solid foundation for a stable future.

If this sounds like you, it's time to bring rationality back into the picture. Cultivate practical thinking and be more realistic. Be open to re-adjusting your expectations. 

## Unmasking Emotions: Not the Villain, but the Hero

From the aforementioned extreme cases, we have learned that emotions are not inherently negative aspects that we should strive to eliminate. In fact, emotions play a vital role in helping us discover our authentic selves and empowering us to take actions.

The solution isn't about suppressing emotions or trying to out-muscle them with sheer force of will. It's about accepting, understanding, and aligning with them. Emotions aren't the villains here; they are the misunderstood heroes. They're trying to protect us, albeit in ways that may seem counterproductive. So, the secret lies in achieving harmony between rationality and emotion.

## The Balance Act: Aligning Rationality and Emotion

So how do we find balance? First, we need to stop the suppression. We need to listen to our emotions, understand them without judgement, and reframe the benefits of the actions we need to take. For instance, fear of failure may prevent a career change, but reframing the situation can help. In this case, we can reframe the situation in this way: if I had enough job security or income security, would I still be afraid? If we had a lot of money, or if we had a second job that could sustain us even if we were laid off from our new job, we might no longer be afraid. So, to solve this problem, we can either get a part-time job or save more money before changing careers.

Overcoming emotional barriers doesn't mean forcing ourselves to leap over them; it means acknowledging them, respecting them, and gradually lowering them until they are no longer barriers.

## Maintaining the Balance: A Long-term Approach

The key to maintaining this balance in the long run lies in the principle of **accumulation**. 

Creating this balance is an ongoing process, requiring consistent practice and patience. Like mastering any skill, you'll have moments of failure. The key lies in cultivating a growth mindset. Learn from your failures rather than viewing them as setbacks.

One effective way to maintain this balance is through self-reflection and mindfulness. By understanding our emotions and recognizing how they affect our decisions, we can manage our reactions and make more informed choices. Practices like journaling your feelings or meditating daily can significantly enhance your self-awareness.

Having a strong support system can also be invaluable. Sharing experiences, gaining new perspectives, and receiving encouragement from others can motivate us during challenging times. Surround yourself with individuals who inspire growth and offer constructive feedback. We can learn from the journeys of others, see how their failure provide fuels to their personal growth. By learning from them, we will also realize that we're not alone in our struggles.

Finally, be kind to yourself. Learn to forgive yourself for your mistakes and see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Remember, intelligence comes from the process of error correction. There are multiple sides to the fact. Failure is undoubtedly dreadful; it represents one side of the equation. However, on the other side, failure provides us with an opportunity to correct ourselves and experience personal growth.

In conclusion, maintaining a balance between rationality and emotion isn't about suppressing one or the other. It's about understanding both, accepting both, and helping both to work in harmony for your benefit. Whether it's the decision to switch careers, adopt a healthier lifestyle, or break away from toxic relationships, remember, it's the balance of rationality and emotion that leads to meaningful action. Understanding and working with your emotions, rather than against them, can bring sustainable change and personal growth. It's a journey, one step at a time, towards a better version of yourself.
