# Rethinking Investments: Why Regular Investing Overpowers the 'Buy the Dip' Strategy

## "Buy the Dip" Strategy

Some worry that as soon as they start buying, the market begins to decline. They fear changing their strategy, especially when their "buy the dip" strategy fails, and they consider shifting to a Regular Investing strategy. They're scared of making another mistake, which would be a blow to their confidence. So, let's dissect this issue and use clear logic to answer their concerns.

Investing inherently involves some risk and unpredictability, a fact we must first acknowledge. Secondly, for those who adopt "buy the dip" strategy, buying at the "wrong" time means purchasing when the future economy is unclear and the market is full of uncertainties. This perception of timing plays an important role in the decision-making process, as investors try to buy at the bottoms to get higher returns. But when prices fall, they may think prices will drop even further and refrain from buying. When the market bottoms out and bounces back, and they realize they've missed the bottom, the current entry point is no longer attractable. If they perform data analysis, they may find that the cost price of purchasing now is actually higher than the average cost price from consistently investing since the peak. At this point, they begin to realize that if they keep investing regularly, regardless of the price, they will see higher returns in the long run.

These two conflicting perspectives clash: investors hope to buy low and sell high for high returns, but also realize that Regular Investing strategy might yield better results over the long term. They begin to understand that because markets will fluctuate, as long as the market eventually rises again, reaching new highs, Regular Investing will yield great returns.

The problem with trying to buy at the lowest bottom is that we will most likely miss the lowest bottom. If we miss it, we might not want to buy again, so we hold onto cash, which doesn't yield any returns. Eventually, our performance lags behind the market. Usually, when we realize we've missed the bottom, it's already too late to buy because the cost of entering the market is higher than the average price of Regular Investing. This may make it even harder for investors to accept that they are falling behind, leading them to take greater risks in an attempt to recoup their missed losses. However, in most cases, such behavior only leads to greater losses. We should understand that we shouldn't always be looking backward; we need to look forward.

Investors have recognized the potential pitfalls of trying to "but the dip" and predict the market, as well as the advantages of Regular Investing. Investing inherently involves some risk and unpredictability. We should keep our position within an acceptable range so that we can continue investing even when prices keep falling. Investing is a long-term process, and we should stick to our principles and follow them consistently. That's how we can ultimately achieve our financial goals.

Some elements are crucial to successful investing, including appropriate position sizing, sticking to consistent principles, and focusing on long-term goals. Given these uncertainties, investors may decide to shift from the "buy the dip" strategy to the Regular Investing strategy. Moving from "buy the dip" to Regular Investing is not an easy decision, as it means giving up potential high short-term returns for long-term sustainable investment success. What factors need to be considered during this transition, and what mindset adjustments need to be made?

## Regular Investing Strategy

First, we should understand that what's done is done – past events are sunk costs, a cognitive bias that can alter our decisions. We need to be aware of it and not let it ruin our decision-making process. Second, shifting to Regular Investing is a long-term solution – we will always be in the market and won't miss buying opportunities like with the "buy the dip" strategy. We won't just be holding cash while watching the market reach new highs. Shifting to Regular Investing means we are focused on long-term sustainable investment success. Third, even if the market falls, it's okay, we just need to keep buying. Because the market will eventually recover and reach new highs. Fourth, make Regular Investing a habit. The longer we do it, the more benefits we see, and we eventually come to believe Regular Investing. No longer will we need our rational mind to force us to continue, we'll automatically stick to the strategy.

Natural emotions like fear or regret, which may arise during the transition period or when a new strategy starts, can be managed by staying away from daily price fluctuations and focusing on other important activities, such as reading books, writing, or learning new skills. Investors can also join Regular Investing communities, where seeing others continue to buy even when the market falls can make them less prone to fear.

Once we take the first step, it's easier to keep going. When we've done it for long enough and see the benefits, we really start to believe in the strategy. This experience strengthens our resolve to do the right thing in the future. So, we need to set a timeline, say, 2 years, where we ignore market fluctuations and just stick to Regular Investing. Because Regular Investing is a long-term strategy, if we don't give it enough time, we won't see its effects.

We should set a buying plan, such as when to buy and how much to buy, and record it in a spreadsheet. When the date arrives, we follow the plan, purchasing and recording the price and quantity we bought. During the implementation of this strategy, we need to constantly remind ourselves that this strategy is something we have chosen after careful and deep consideration. It is part of our long-term plan, and we should stick to it instead of making impulsive decisions during market fluctuations.

The main goal of the Regular Investing strategy is to offset market fluctuations and gain positive returns through long-term holdings. Furthermore, in the long run, Regular Investing is easier to execute than trying to buy at the lowest bottom, as we don't need to constantly monitor market fluctuations. We just need to follow our buying plan and wait patiently.

In our Regular Investing process, we should avoid focusing too much on short-term market dynamics, as this could influence our judgment, leading to fear or greed and, in turn, poor decisions. We should focus on our long-term investment goals and believe that the market will eventually go in the direction we expect.

In conclusion, fear only leaves us behind on our investment journey. Facing it bravely and sticking to our strategy is what leads us to success. Investing is not only about buying low and selling high; it's also about adjusting our mindset and long-term principles. If we stay calm, stick to the Regular Investing strategy, and believe in the power of the market, we will eventually achieve our investment goals.
