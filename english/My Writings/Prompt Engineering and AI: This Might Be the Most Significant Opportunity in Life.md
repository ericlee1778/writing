# Prompt Engineering and AI: This Might Be the Most Significant Opportunity in Life

For me, this might be the most important article I've ever written. Why do I consider it significant? Because it involves my own life experiences, it is the process by which I gradually moved from chaos and confusion to order, and it is my understanding and observation of learning and growth. For you, I believe it will be incredibly enlightening.

First, let me backtrack to my childhood. I was not a clever student then, and even faced two major crossroads in my life due to poor academic performance. However, I consider myself very fortunate to have had these two experiences, because without them, my life might have taken a different trajectory.

### Primary School Experience

Let's start with my primary school experience. Back then, I performed very poorly in the Malay language in the [UPSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School_Achievement_Test_(Malaysia)) mock exam. The fear, the dreadâ€”I remember it vividly even today. At that time, I wanted to align myself with my peers as much as possible, not wanting to have to spend an extra year in a foundational class (when going to secondary school) because of my poor grades, while others could directly enter middle school. This was something I couldn't accept.

Upon learning of my grades, my mother didn't blame me. Instead, she quietly took me from one tuition center to another, hoping to find a place that could assure my pass in Malay in a short time. I was very weak at that time, unable to make the decision to change my fate independently. I feel very fortunate to have had a mother who could lend a hand and offer support when I was most confused and helpless.

When the results were announced, my expectation became a reality. As I had guessed, only a very few students in the class were admitted to the foundational class. For me, I did not do very well, just barely passing. Despite this, it was the first time that I vaguely realized that learning could change one's fate. The idea wasn't very clear, but it planted a seed in my mind.

### Secondary School Experience

Reflecting on my secondary school period, history repeated itself. This time, it was my history subject in the Lower Secondary Assessment mock exam that was disastrous. This implied that I hadn't learned much from my primary school experience and hadn't become more diligent. This was to be expected because the motivation derived from fear is temporary and unsustainable. If we rely on fear to force ourselves to progress, we will quickly return to square one. This can lead to a sense of defeat, eroding our confidence, hindering our next attempt, and depriving us of the courage to take on new challenges. This hesitation between wanting to do something but not daring to will plunge us into despair.

Facing this setback in secondary school, my internal thought was:

> "Again?"

I felt utterly hopeless that the same thing was happening to me again. This failure came without any warning, as my history grades had always been passable in the exams prior to the mock exam.

Fortunately, due to my experience in primary school, I had gained some experience. This time, I was able to choose how to make a change. Although still very desperate, I thought about it for an afternoon and then asked my mother to take me to the bookstore, where we bought past year exam papers for history. My mother, upon learning that I had failed in history subject, didn't blame me. Like before, she silently supported me, with not a word of reprimand. She just took me to buy books.

During that time, I received considerable assistance. Three months before the final exam, an excellent teacher joined my tuition center, who helped us review three years of secondary school history subjects. This time the result was much more satisfactory than in primary school. My history grade rose from a fail to an excellent 'A' grade. After this experience, I never encountered similar troubles again. I guess that's because these two successes gave me confidence and made me realize that learning has techniques and that learning itself is a skill that needs cultivation.

### University Experience

Next, let me talk about my university experience. During my university years, something happened that changed my life. One day, a professor asked us in class about our goals for the final exam. When it was my turn, I bragged that my goal was to achieve the highest grades in all my subjects. The whole class burst into applause because nobody had ever made such a bold statement before. I was very nervous when I said it; in fact, I didn't believe I could do it.

However, this commitment planted a seed in my heart. My subconscious kept telling me that I must fulfill this promise. Even though no one would probably remember or pay attention to that episode, I started to take it seriously! Although I didn't achieve the highest grade at the end, the results were pretty good. Among the entire grade level, my performance could be ranked in the top 10% or even the top 5%. Since then, my academic grades have always been excellent, consistently at the top level.

### Post-University

After graduating from university, I started a habit: writing. Counting both publicly published and privately written pieces, I've written nearly 40 articles. Compared to those who have been writing for a long time, my quantity is not substantial. However, the content of my public articles share a characteristic: they contain truths I firmly believe in and are products of my genuine thought process. To me, if even I am not convinced by the concept presented in my article, it doesn't warrant being published.

To me, writing is a form of effective learning, much like doing past year exam papers. It is both a way of learning and a means of outputting knowledge. Just like if we practice more exam questions, we can better understand the exam content and achieve better grades. Learning can be divided into two forms:

> * Input
> * Output

Input is a passive form of learning. Only through continuous practice, enabling us to output what we've learned, can we better understand and master it.
