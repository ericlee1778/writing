# Take off your mask, are you willing to face your true self?

Concept of this chapter: Being genuine

*The content of this article comes from Li Xiaolai's video sharing in June 2020 on the topic "Being Genuine" in the series "Seven Years Later".*

Do you ever feel like an actor in your life, always using different masks, playing different roles, to face different people?

For instance, in front of your boss, you have to pretend to be very diligent and competent; in front of your colleagues, you have to appear friendly and cooperative; with your friends, you strive to be witty and interesting; and around your family, you try to be obedient and responsible...

**Do you think this is right?**

## Why Do We Love to Pretend?

We may love to pretend for several reasons:

> - Wanting to leave a good impression and maintain a positive image.
> - Not wanting to expose our weaknesses and flaws.
> - Hoping to gain approval and praise from others.
> - Trying to adapt to different environments and situations.

These reasons may seem reasonable, but are they worth pretending for?

Ask yourself this question:

> In reality, how many roles do you play? How many masks do you wear? Don't you feel tired?

## The Resource Curse

There's a concept in economics called the [Resource Curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse). The possession of abundant natural resources in a country or region is not necessarily a good thing, with some common examples being the diamond wars in Africa and the oil crisis in Venezuela.

The Resource Curse applies to personal growth too:

> Because we have plenty of resources, we don't need to work hard, then we become overly reliant on these resources. When these resources are exhausted, we can't do anything and we're incapable of anything, ending up like fools.

Pretending is like a hallucinatory resource, we use the pretended images to trade for what we want. As we see the benefits, although we know that continuous pretending is not sustainable, we can't give up the immediate benefits and thus keep pretending. In order to maintain the image, we pay a huge price for this mask time and time again, hindering our own growth in the process.

Because we are not good enough, we pretend. The more we pretend, the more tired we become, the more tired we are, the worse we get, and the worse we get, the more we pretend.

Those who worse, pretend more, in order to mask their weaknesses and flaws.

The more you pretend, the worse you get, and the worse you get, the more you rely on pretending.

People who love to pretend, tend to think that others are also pretending, as they can't believe that how others could possibly be that good, they must be pretending too.

This is a terrifying curse...

## How Great is the Cost of Pretending?

In the long run, the cost of pretending is enormous. The more masks you wear, the more exhausted you become, the more attention span and energy you consume, and the less attention span and energy you can put on important tasks.

Over time, pretending will make us worse.

Secondly, pretending makes us more and more tired. Why is that?

> Because when we use masks to deal with different people and situations, we consume a lot of attention span and time. We have to constantly monitor our words and behaviors to not give ourselves away. We need to switch roles without making mistakes. We have to bear the risk and pressure of being exposed, without any chance to relax.

Finally, pretending makes us more and more lonely. Why is that?

> Because when we use masks to hide our true feelings, we lose real intimacy and trust. We feel that others do not understand or care about us. We feel that we have no real connection or communication with others. We feel like an island, with no one to rely on or share with.

As teenagers, we were passionate, wanting to accomplish great things.

In our youth, we were awakened by a nightmare called society, and as we sat up in bed, we pondered the path ahead.

In our middle age, we are physically and mentally exhausted, although reluctant, but has accepted the status quo, do not want to change.

In our old age, we believe in fate, convinced that misfortunes are predestined.

Do you know what scares me the most?

> Watching myself slowly turn into the person I despised the most as a teenager, the worst part is, I can do nothing about it. It's as if there's a black hole in front of me, no matter how much I struggle, I can't avoid its accelerating pull.

This exhaustion and drain, leading to an unwillingness to change and a resignation to the status quo, is partly due to the continuous pretense over time.

**Since pretending has so many downsides, how should we take off our masks? How can we stop pretending?**

## Methodology for Not Pretending

### Stop Pointless Comparisons ðŸ›‘

One of the reasons we love to pretend is because we always compare ourselves to others, feeling that we are not as good. We must realize this and stop these pointless comparisons, only then can we focus on our own growth.

But what if we can't stop comparing?

### Modify Your Comparison Mode ðŸ”„

If you really can't avoid comparing, then you can try to change who you compare yourself to and how you compare. Psychologist Carol Dweck identified and proposed two mindsets that influence our comparative behavior:

> 1. Fixed mindset
> 2. Growth mindset
