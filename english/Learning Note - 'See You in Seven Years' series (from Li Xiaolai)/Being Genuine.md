# Take off your mask! Are you willing to face your true self?

Concept of this chapter: Being genuine

*The content of this article comes from Li Xiaolai's video sharing in June 2020 on the topic "Being Genuine" in the series "Seven Years Later".*

Do you ever feel like an actor in your life, always using different masks, playing different roles, to face different people?

For instance, in front of your boss, you have to pretend to be very diligent and competent; in front of your colleagues, you have to appear friendly and cooperative; with your friends, you strive to be witty and interesting; and around your family, you try to be obedient and responsible...

**Do you think this is right?**

## Why Do We Love to Pretend?

We may love to pretend for several reasons:

> - Wanting to leave a good impression and maintain a positive image.
> - Not wanting to expose our weaknesses and flaws.
> - Hoping to gain approval and praise from others.
> - Trying to adapt to different environments and situations.

These reasons may seem reasonable, but are they worth pretending for?

Ask yourself this question:

> In reality, how many roles do you play? How many masks do you wear? Don't you feel tired?

## The Resource Curse

There's a concept in economics called the [Resource Curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse). The possession of abundant natural resources in a country or region is not necessarily a good thing, with some common examples being the diamond wars in Africa and the oil crisis in Venezuela.

The Resource Curse applies to personal growth too:

> Because we have plenty of resources, we don't need to work hard, then we become overly reliant on these resources. When these resources are exhausted, we can't do anything and we're incapable of anything, ending up like fools.

Pretending is like a hallucinatory resource, we use the pretended images to trade for what we want. As we see the benefits, although we know that continuous pretending is not sustainable, we can't give up the immediate benefits and thus keep pretending. In order to maintain the image, we pay a huge price for this mask time and time again, hindering our own growth in the process.

Because we are not good enough, we pretend. The more we pretend, the more tired we become, the more tired we are, the worse we get, and the worse we get, the more we pretend.

Those who worse, pretend more, in order to mask their weaknesses and flaws.

The more you pretend, the worse you get, and the worse you get, the more you rely on pretending.

People who love to pretend, tend to think that others are also pretending, as they can't believe that how others could possibly be that good, they must be pretending too.

This is a terrifying curse...

## How Great is the Cost of Pretending?

In the long run, the cost of pretending is enormous. The more masks you wear, the more exhausted you become, the more attention span and energy you consume, and the less attention span and energy you can put on important tasks.

Over time, pretending will make us worse.

Secondly, pretending makes us more and more tired. Why is that?

> Because when we use masks to deal with different people and situations, we consume a lot of attention span and time. We have to constantly monitor our words and behaviors to not give ourselves away. We need to switch roles without making mistakes. We have to bear the risk and pressure of being exposed, without any chance to relax.

Finally, pretending makes us more and more lonely. Why is that?

> Because when we use masks to hide our true feelings, we lose real intimacy and trust. We feel that others do not understand or care about us. We feel that we have no real connection or communication with others. We feel like an island, with no one to rely on or share with.

As teenagers, we were passionate, wanting to accomplish great things.

In our youth, we were awakened by a nightmare called society, and as we sat up in bed, we pondered the path ahead.

In our middle age, we are physically and mentally exhausted, although reluctant, but has accepted the status quo, do not want to change.

In our old age, we believe in fate, convinced that misfortunes are predestined.

Do you know what scares me the most?

> Watching myself slowly turn into the person I despised the most as a teenager, the worst part is, I can do nothing about it. It's as if there's a black hole in front of me, no matter how much I struggle, I can't avoid its accelerating pull.

This exhaustion and drain, leading to an unwillingness to change and a resignation to the status quo, is partly due to the continuous pretense over time.

**Since pretending has so many downsides, how should we take off our masks? How can we stop pretending?**

## Methodology for Not Pretending

### Stop Pointless Comparisons 🛑

One of the reasons we love to pretend is because we always compare ourselves to others, feeling that we are not as good. We must realize this and stop these pointless comparisons, only then can we focus on our own growth.

But what if we can't stop comparing?

### Modify Your Comparison Mode 🔄

If you really can't avoid comparing, then you can try to change who you compare yourself to and how you compare. Psychologist Carol Dweck identified and proposed two mindsets that influence our comparative behavior:

> 1. Fixed mindset
> 2. Growth mindset

People with a fixed mindset tend to believe their abilities are static and unchangeable. They often compare their present selves with others and, more often than not, end up feeling defeated. They perceive themselves as incapable and useless.

On the other hand, individuals with a growth mindset believe their skills can be improved through effort and learning. They compare their current selves with their past selves or others' past achievements. The outstanding performance of others is attributed to their long-term commitment, so it is only fair to compare oneself with the others at the beginning of their journeys. Given more time, they might not lag far behind their current counterparts.

People with a forward-thinking or growth mindset don't need to pretend because they understand that nobody is inherently superior; it's all a matter of time spent accumulating skills and experiences. There's no need to pretend. Just keep progressing, and eventually, you'll get to where you want to be.

Interestingly, while people with a fixed mindset often feel defeated by comparison, those with a growth mindset find it increasingly exciting. This is a perfect example of a mirror world.

Mirror world:

> It seems like we are doing the same thing, but the mindset is opposite, so the outcomes are inevitably different.

Ask yourself every day:

> Have you made any comparisons today? Have you shifted to a growth mindset?

When we ask ourselves these questions, we activate our metacognition. This allows us to step back and examine whether our thinking and behavior patterns have become growth based.

### Achieving Growth through Long-Term Commitment 🌱

The most effective method for not pretending is to achieve growth through long-term commitment. When you have an in-depth understanding and mastery of something, you will confidently display your abilities and value without the need for any external embellishment.

So, what's the root of pretense?

> Lack of specialized skills... Therefore, one can only pretend.

When you've honed a particular skill, people will look at you differently, and your other shortcomings become more tolerable to them.

This is because they believe you're truly exceptional, hence they admire you.

They might even say:

> Who doesn't have flaws?

Here's an interesting way to think about it:

> Are we not pretending because we've become awesome, or have we become awesome because we stopped pretending?

We can choose to interpret it this way:

> We stop pretending, and thus have more attention span to focus on self-improvement, gradually achieving one thing after another until we finally become awesome.

### Don't Maintain a Pretentious Persona 🙅‍♂️

Some people might believe that pretending is a necessary means, a social skill, a method of managing their image. They deliberately sculpt an image that meets their expectations or those of others and use this persona to interact and communicate.

This tactic might seem clever, but it's actually foolish because a fake persona will eventually collapse. When you can no longer maintain the image you've crafted, your true self is exposed. At that moment, you'll find all your effort has been wasted, and the trust and respect you've gained disappear.

## How to Attain Lasting Satisfaction from Success?

What is lasting satisfaction? During the pursuit of a goal, you achieve success that yields long-term and sustainable returns for both you and those you care about, rather than fleeting success. This kind of success brings lasting satisfaction, instead of worrying about losing hard-won success and being trapped in the game of chasing the next goal.

The 2004 Harvard Business Review article [Success That Lasts](https://hbr.org/2004/02/success-that-lasts) described lasting satisfaction as being comprised of four indispensable aspects:

> 1. Happiness
> 2. Achievement
> 3. Significance
> 4. Legacy

We can look at these four aspects from another perspective:
> 1. Self
> 2. Family
> 3. Work/Career
> 4. Community/Society

By extrapolation, this concept can be used to examine our thinking and determine what concepts are correct.

One who maintain fake persona can pretend to be happy in front of others (family, colleagues, society), but can they really cheat themselves that they are truly happy? The mask will eventually be taken off, but they can not do anything about it, they can only continue to pretend. As long as they are ultimately weak, every pretense of them will be afraid of being demolished, this pressure comes from the sense of powerlessness for their own weakness.

Observing pretense from life:

> Look at the people around you who are pretending. See what price they have paid.

Can a pretense be passed on? No, it cannot, and it dare not. Nobody would bear to see their child ignore their own issues, wearing a mask, learning to pretend, and licking their wounds in solitude at the midnight.

When we can manage not to pretend, we can serve as a role model for our children. They can also learn not to pretend and cultivate a habit of a growth mindset.

Not to pretend. Face reality with a growth mindset, accumulate capabilities, and finally learn to sincerely love yourself.

Being yourself is good, but being genuinely in love with who you are is even better.

Be yourself and glad to be yourself.

Thoughts and Actions:

> 1. How many roles do you play in real life?
> 2. Have you made any comparisons today? Have you shifted to a growth mindset?
> 3. Is it because you've become awesome that you don't need to pretend, or is it that by not pretending, you've ultimately become awesome?
> 4. Observe the people around you who are pretending. See what price they have paid.
