The reasons I want to start this new writing project, which is about my life stories, are:
1. Writing has become so easy with the assistance of ChatGPT. I want to use ChatGPT more, and I truly enjoy creating meaningful products with it. To me, writing is a form of production.
  
2. I learned an unforgettable concept from one of my favorite writers, Kong Keen Yung. "For everyone in the world, if you were to film a movie of your selected life stories, the movie producer wouldn't lose money. As the movie definitely would be interesting enough to gather enough people to watch, resulting all the costs of production can be covered." I truly believe in this concept.
  
3. I have done a YouTube video series with my friend in the past. We did one story for each year from childhood to our current age. This experience further inspired me to make it a life project to record my life stories.
  
4. I believe I have a better memory than most people, but I can still feel that I'm forgetting my past stories as I age. It bothers me because I know that as I grow older, I'll forget some of my most precious memories if I don't write them down.
  
5. Cultivate vulnerability. Sharing the most authentic parts of myself is one of the most vulnerable things I can imagine doing.
  
6. At the time of writing this (2H2023), I have delved deeply into the rabbit hole of MBTI personality types. I have mostly INTJ tendencies (and I believe I also have a bit of an ISTJ tendency; otherwise, it's hard to explain my good memory). As an INTJ, improving my extraverted thinking is the best leverage point for personal growth. By sharing my life stories, I'm creating a connection between my inner world and the outer world. Extraverted thinking is about making things happen, creating and building things in real life rather than keeping them in my inner world. Turning my life stories into articles is a form of product creation.
